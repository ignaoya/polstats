From 1789 to 1913, senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented.  They are now elected by popular vote following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. In the early 20th century[when?], the practice of majority and minority parties electing their floor leaders began. The Senate's legislative and executive business is managed and scheduled by the Senate majority leader.
