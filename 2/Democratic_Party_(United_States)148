Catholic Americans have traditionally been a stronghold for the Democratic Party, although they have become more divided between the two major parties in recent years. Both Catholics elected to be president, John F. Kennedy and Joe Biden, have been Democrats.[266] Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is also Catholic.[267]
