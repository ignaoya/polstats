Trump was impeached on December 18, 2019, on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.[109][110] He was acquitted by the Senate on February 5, 2020.[111] 195 of the 197 Republicans within the House voted against the charges with none voting in favor, the two abstaining Republicans were due to external reasons unrelated to the impeachment itself.[112] 52 of the 53 Republicans within the Senate voted against the charges as well, successfully acquitting Trump as a result, with only Senator Mitt Romney of Utah dissenting and voting in favor of one of the charges (abuse of power).[113][114] Following his refusal to concede his loss in the 2020 elections, which led to the U.S. Capitol being stormed by his supporters on January 6, 2021, the House impeached Trump for a second time on charges of incitement of insurrection, making him the only federal officeholder in the history of the United States to be impeached twice.[115][116] He left office on January 20, 2021, but the impeachment continued into the early weeks of the Biden administration, with him being ultimately acquitted a second time by the Senate on February 13, 2021.[117] Seven Republicans voted to impeach, including Romney once again, Richard Burr, Bill Cassidy, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Ben Sasse and Pat Toomey. Their states' respective Republican parties condemned them for doing so, as well, Republican U.S. Representative Liz Cheney was censured by her state GOP for her impeachment vote in the House.[118][119] In response to Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 elections and the subsequent storming of the U.S. Capitol, dozens of Republican former members of the Bush administration made their abandonment of the party public, calling it the "cult of Trump."[120]
