According to an analysis in Political Science Quarterly, Trump made "explicitly racist appeals to whites" during his 2016 presidential campaign.[825] In particular, his campaign launch speech drew widespread criticism for claiming Mexican immigrants were "bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists."[826][827] His later comments about a Mexican-American judge presiding over a civil suit regarding Trump University were also criticized as racist.[828]
