Perón died the next year; his widow and vice president Isabel took over the presidency.[1]  Perón's death left an intense power vacuum and the military promptly overthrew Isabel in 1976.[1] Following the return to democracy in 1983 Peronist candidates dominated the presidency. In 37 years of democracy, Peronists held the presidency for 24 years.
