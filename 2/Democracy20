The term democracy first appeared in ancient Greek political and philosophical thought in the city-state of Athens during classical antiquity.[36][37] The word comes from demos '(common) people' and kratos 'strength'.[38] Led by Cleisthenes, Athenians established what is generally held as the first democracy in 508â€“507 BC. Cleisthenes is referred to as "the father of Athenian democracy".[39]
