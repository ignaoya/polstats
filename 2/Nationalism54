In his 1992 article Jihad vs. McWorld, Benjamin Barber proposed that the fall of communism will cause large numbers of people to search for unity and that small scale wars will become common; groups will attempt to redraw boundaries, identities, cultures and ideologies.[95] Communism's fall also allowed for an "us vs. them" mentality to sprout up.[96] Governments become vehicles for social interests and the country will attempt to form national policies based on the majority, for example culture, religion or ethnicity.[94] Some newly sprouted democracies have large differences in policies on matters that ranged from immigration and human rights to trade and commerce.
