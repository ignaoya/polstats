Prior to the pandemic, Trump criticized the WHO and other international bodies, which he asserted were taking advantage of U.S. aid.[572] His administration's proposed 2021 federal budget, released in February, proposed reducing WHO funding by more than half.[572] In May and April, Trump accused the WHO of "severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus" and alleged without evidence that the organization was under Chinese control and had enabled the Chinese government's concealment of the origins of the pandemic.[572][573][574] He then announced that he was withdrawing funding for the organization.[572] Trump's criticisms and actions regarding the WHO were seen as attempts to distract attention from his own mishandling of the pandemic.[572][575][576] In July 2020, Trump announced the formal withdrawal of the United States from the WHO effective July 2021.[573][574] The decision was widely condemned by health and government officials as "short-sighted," "senseless," and "dangerous."[573][574]
