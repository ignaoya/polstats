According to the convention of Senate seniority, the senator with the longer tenure in each state is known as the "senior senator"; the other is the "junior senator". This convention does not have official significance, though seniority generally is a factor in the selection of physical offices and in party caucuses' assignment of committees.[31] In the 117th Congress, the most-senior "junior senator" is Maria Cantwell of Washington, who was sworn in on January 3, 2001, and is currently 16th in seniority, behind Patty Murray who was sworn in on January 3, 1993, and is currently 6th in seniority. The most-junior "senior senator" is Jon Ossoff of Georgia, who was sworn in on January 20, 2021, and is 99th in seniority, ahead of Raphael Warnock, who was sworn in on the same day.
