Philosopher and scholar Achille Mbembe argues that post-colonialism is a contradictory term, because colonialism is ever present.[158] Those that participate in this intellectual practice envision a post-colonialism despite its being the defining frame for the world. This is the case with anti-colonialism as well. Anti-colonial nationalism as an intellectual framework persisted into the late 20th century with the resistance movements in Soviet satellite states, and continues with independence movements in the Arab world in the 21st century. It is also one of the defining factors of stateless nationalism in Turkey, Morocco and Palestine. Â
