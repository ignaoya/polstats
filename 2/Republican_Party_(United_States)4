After 1912, the Republican Party began to undergo an ideological shift to the right.[13] Following the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the party's core base shifted, with Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics.[14] After the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, the Republican Party opposed abortion in its party platform and grew its support among evangelicals.[15] Its 21st-century ideology is American conservatism, which incorporates both social conservatism and fiscal conservatism. The GOP supports lower taxes, free-market capitalism, restrictions on immigration, increased military spending, gun rights, restrictions on abortion, deregulation, and restrictions on labor unions.[16] The party's voter base in the 21st century largely includes white men,[17] people living in rural areas, members of the Silent Generation, people with less education,[18] and evangelical Christians.[19]  Its most recent presidential nominee was Donald Trump, and most Republicans are generally supportive of his opinions and actions.[20][21]
