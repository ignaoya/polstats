The First Continental Congress was a gathering of representatives from twelve of the thirteen colonies of North America.[9] On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, referring to the new nation as the "United States of America." The Articles of Confederation in 1781 created the Congress of the Confederation, a unicameral body with equal representation among the states in which each state had a veto over most decisions. Congress had executive but not legislative authority, and the federal judiciary was confined to admiralty.[10] and lacked authority to collect taxes, regulate commerce, or enforce laws.[11][12]
