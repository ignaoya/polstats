Historically, democracies and republics have been rare.[33] Republican theorists linked democracy to small size: as political units grew in size, the likelihood increased that the government would turn despotic.[33][34] At the same time, small political units were vulnerable to conquest.[33] Montesquieu wrote, "If a republic be small, it is destroyed by a foreign force; if it be large, it is ruined by an internal imperfection."[35] According to Johns Hopkins University political scientist Daniel Deudney, the creation of the United States, with its large size and its system of checks and balances, was a solution to the dual problems of size.[33]
