Though this was an intentional part of the Connecticut Compromise, critics have described the fact that representation in the Senate is not proportional to the population as "anti-democratic" and "minority rule".[54][55] Opinion columnist David Leonhardt points out[56] that because small states are disproportionately non-Hispanic European American, African Americans have 75% of their proportionate voting power in the Senate, and Hispanic Americans have just 55%. The approximately four million Americans that have no representation in the Senate (in the District of Columbia and U.S. territories) are heavily African and Hispanic American. Leonhardt and others advocate for admitting Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico as states (both have more residents than the smallest existing states) to reduce this inequity.
