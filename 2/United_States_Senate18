Originally, senators were selected by the state legislatures, not by popular elections. By the early years of the 20th century, the legislatures of as many as 29 states had provided for popular election of senators by referendums.[15] Popular election to the Senate was standardized nationally in 1913 by the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment.
