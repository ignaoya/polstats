Equity feminism is a form of liberal feminism discussed since the 1980s,[120][121] specifically a kind of classically liberal or libertarian feminism.[122] Steven Pinker, an evolutionary psychologist, defines equity feminism as "a moral doctrine about equal treatment that makes no commitments regarding open empirical issues in psychology or biology".[123] Barry Kuhle asserts that equity feminism is compatible with evolutionary psychology in contrast to gender feminism.[124]
