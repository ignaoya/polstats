On February 15, 2019, after Trump received from Congress only $1.375 billion for border fencing after demanding $5.7 billion for the Trump wall, he declared a National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States in hopes of getting another $6.7 billion without congressional approval, using funds for military construction, drug interdiction, and money from the Treasury.[397] In doing so, Trump acknowledged that he "didn't need to" declare a national emergency, but he "would rather do it much faster."[397]
