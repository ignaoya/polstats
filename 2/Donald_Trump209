Some of Trump's falsehoods were inconsequential, such as his claims of a large crowd size during his inauguration.[775][776] Others had more far-reaching effects, such as Trump's promotion of unproven antimalarial drugs as a treatment for COVIDâ€‘19 in a press conference and on Twitter in March 2020.[777][778] The claims had consequences worldwide, such as a shortage of these drugs in the United States and panic-buying in Africa and South Asia.[779][780] Other misinformation, such as misattributing a rise in crime in England and Wales to the "spread of radical Islamic terror," served Trump's domestic political purposes.[781] As a matter of principle, Trump does not apologize for his falsehoods.[782]
