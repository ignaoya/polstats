Libertarian socialism, sometimes called left-libertarianism,[505][506] social anarchism[507][508] and socialist libertarianism,[509] is an anti-authoritarian, anti-statist and libertarian[510] tradition within socialism that rejects centralised state ownership and control[511] including criticism of wage labour relationships (wage slavery)[512] as well as the state itself.[513] It emphasises workers' self-management[513] and decentralised structures of political organisation.[514] Libertarian socialism asserts that a society based on freedom and equality can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian institutions that control production.[515] Libertarian socialists generally prefer direct democracy and federal or confederal associations such as libertarian municipalism, citizens' assemblies, trade unions and workers' councils.[516][517]
