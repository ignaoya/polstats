Socialist politics has been both internationalist and nationalist in orientation; organised through political parties and opposed to party politics; at times overlapping with trade unions and at other times independent and critical of them; and present in both industrialised and developing nations.[34] Social democracy originated within the socialist movement,[35] supporting economic and social interventions to promote social justice.[36][37] While retaining socialism as a long-term goal,[38][39][40][41][42] since the post-war period it has come to embrace a Keynesian mixed economy within a predominantly developed capitalist market economy and liberal democratic polity that expands state intervention to include income redistribution, regulation and a welfare state.[43] Economic democracy proposes a sort of market socialism, with more democratic control of companies, currencies, investments and natural resources.[44]
