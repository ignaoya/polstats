On February 27, 2009, President Obama announced: "As a candidate for president, I made clear my support for a timeline of 16 months to carry out this drawdown, while pledging to consult closely with our military commanders upon taking office to ensure that we preserve the gains we've made and protect our troops [...] Those consultations are now complete, and I have chosen a timeline that will remove our combat brigades over the next 18 months".[207] Around 50,000 non-combat-related forces would remain.[207] Obama's plan drew wide bipartisan support, including that of defeated Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain.[207][needs update]
