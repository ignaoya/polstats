The Great Depression ushered in President Franklin Roosevelt and strong control by Democrats[31] and historic New Deal policies. Roosevelt's election in 1932 marked a shift in government power towards the executive branch. Numerous New Deal initiatives came from the White House rather than being initiated by Congress.[32] President Roosevelt pushed his agenda in Congress by detailing Executive Branch staff to friendly Senate committees (a practice that ended with the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946).[33] The Democratic Party controlled both houses of Congress for many years.[34][35][36] During this time, Republicans and conservative southern Democrats[37] formed the Conservative Coalition.[36][38] Democrats maintained control of Congress during World War II.[39][40] Congress struggled with efficiency in the postwar era partly by reducing the number of standing congressional committees.[41] Southern Democrats became a powerful force in many influential committees although political power alternated between Republicans and Democrats during these years. More complex issues required greater specialization and expertise, such as space flight and atomic energy policy.[41] Senator Joseph McCarthy exploited the fear of communism during the Second Red Scare and conducted televised hearings.[42][43] In 1960, Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy narrowly won the presidency and power shifted again to the Democrats who dominated both houses of Congress until 1994.
