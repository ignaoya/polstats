Blanquism is a conception of revolution named for Louis Auguste Blanqui. It holds that socialist revolution should be carried out by a relatively small group of highly organised and secretive conspirators.[493] Upon seizing power, the revolutionaries introduce socialism.[494] Rosa Luxemburg and Eduard Bernstein[495] criticised Lenin, stating that his conception of revolution was elitist and Blanquist.[496] Marxismâ€“Leninism combines Marx's scientific socialist concepts and Lenin's anti-imperialism, democratic centralism and vanguardism.[497]
