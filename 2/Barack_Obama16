In June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin.[70] Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date.[71] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.[72] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilization to conceive their children.[73] The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998,[74] followed by a second daughter, Natasha ("Sasha"), in 2001.[75] The Obama daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School.[76] The Obamas have two Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named Bo, was a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy.[77] In 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female.[78]
