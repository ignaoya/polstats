Before and throughout his presidency, Trump has promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including "birtherism," the Clinton Body Count theory, QAnon, and alleged Ukrainian interference in U.S. elections.[791] In October 2020, Trump retweeted a QAnon follower who asserted that Osama bin Laden was still alive, a body double had been killed in his place, and that "Biden and Obama may have had SEAL Team Six killed."[792]
