Liberal nationalism is kind of non-xenophobic nationalism that is claimed to be compatible with liberal values of freedom, tolerance, equality, and individual rights.[160][161][162] Ernest Renan[163] and John Stuart Mill[164] are often thought to be early liberal nationalists. Liberal nationalists often defend the value of national identity by saying that individuals need a national identity to lead meaningful, autonomous lives,[165][166] and that liberal democratic polities need national identity to function properly.[167][168]
