Each chamber determines its own internal rules of operation unless specified in the Constitution or prescribed by law. In the House, a Rules Committee guides legislation; in the Senate, a Standing Rules committee is in charge. Each branch has its own traditions; for example, the Senate relies heavily on the practice of getting "unanimous consent" for noncontroversial matters.[2] House and Senate rules can be complex, sometimes requiring a hundred specific steps before a bill can become a law.[3] Members sometimes turn to outside experts to learn about proper Congressional procedures.[125]
