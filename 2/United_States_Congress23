Important structural changes included the direct popular election of senators according to the Seventeenth Amendment,[16] ratified on April 8, 1913, with positive effects (senators more sensitive to public opinion) and negative effects (undermining the authority of state governments).[16] Supreme Court decisions based on the Constitution's commerce clause expanded congressional power to regulate the economy.[28] One effect of popular election of senators was to reduce the difference between the House and Senate in terms of their link to the electorate.[29] Lame duck reforms according to the Twentieth Amendment reduced the power of defeated and retiring members of Congress to wield influence despite their lack of accountability.[30]
