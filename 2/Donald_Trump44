The Donald J. Trump Foundation was a private foundation established in 1988.[147][148] In the foundation's final years its funds mostly came from donors other than Trump, who did not donate any personal funds to the charity from 2009 until 2014.[149] The foundation gave to health care and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[150]
