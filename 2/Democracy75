Within modern-day representative governments, certain electoral tools like referendums, citizens' initiatives and recall elections are referred to as forms of direct democracy.[168] However, some advocates of direct democracy argue for local assemblies of face-to-face discussion. Direct democracy as a government system currently exists in the Swiss cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden and Glarus,[169] the Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities,[170] communities affiliated with the CIPO-RFM,[171] the Bolivian city councils of FEJUVE,[172] and Kurdish cantons of Rojava.[173]
