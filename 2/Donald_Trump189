Breaking with precedent, Trump filed to run for a second term with the FEC within a few hours of assuming the presidency.[684] Trump held his first re-election rally less than a month after taking office.[685][686] In his first two years in office, Trump's reelection committee reported raising $67.5 million, allowing him to begin 2019 with $19.3 million cash on hand.[687] From the beginning of 2019 through July 2020, the Trump campaign and Republican Party raised $1.1 billion but spent $800 million of that amount, losing their cash advantage over the Democratic nominee, former vice president Joe Biden.[688] The cash shortage forced the campaign to scale-back advertising spending.[689]
