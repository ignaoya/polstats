In April 2019, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas seeking financial details from Trump's banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, and his accounting firm, Mazars USA. In response, Trump sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chairman Elijah Cummings to prevent the disclosures.[115][116] In May, DC District Court judge Amit Mehta ruled that Mazars must comply with the subpoena,[117] and judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District Court of New York ruled that the banks must also comply.[118][119] Trump's attorneys appealed the rulings,[120] arguing that Congress was attempting to usurp the "exercise of law-enforcement authority that the Constitution reserves to the executive branch."[121][122]
