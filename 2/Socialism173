In the late 19th century, anarcho-naturism fused anarchism and naturist philosophies within individualist anarchist circles in France, Spain, Cuba[560] and Portugal.[561] Murray Bookchin's first book Our Synthetic Environment[562] was followed by his essay "Ecology and Revolutionary Thought" which introduced ecology as a concept in radical politics.[563] In the 1970s, Barry Commoner, claimed that capitalist technologies were chiefly responsible for environmental degradation as opposed to population pressures.[564] In the 1990s socialist/feminists Mary Mellor[565] and Ariel Salleh[566] adopt an eco-socialist paradigm. An "environmentalism of the poor" combining ecological awareness and social justice has also become prominent.[567] Pepper critiqued the current approach of many within green politics, particularly deep ecologists.[568]
