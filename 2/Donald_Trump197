On January 6, 2021, while congressional certification of the presidential election results was occurring in the Capitol, Trump held a rally nearby, where he called for the election result to be overturned and urged his supporters to "take back our country" by marching to the Capitol to "show strength" and "fight like hell."[724][725] Thousands of those supporters then stormed the Capitol around 1 pm, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress. During the violence, Trump posted mixed messages on Twitter and Facebook, eventually tweeting to the rioters at 6 pm, "go home with love & in peace," but describing them as "great patriots" and "very special," 
while still complaining that the election was stolen.[726][727] After the mob was removed from the Capitol, Congress reconvened and confirmed the Biden election win in the early hours of the following morning.[728] Five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died as a consequence of the riot.[729][730][731]
