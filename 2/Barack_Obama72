The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.[285][286] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1 million,[286][287][288][289] while conceding that "It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package."[285] Although an April 2010, survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73 percent of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.[290] The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of World War II.[291] The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the U.S. and the austerity measures in the European Union.[292]
