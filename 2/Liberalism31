Besides liberty, liberals have developed several other principles important to the construction of their philosophical structure, such as equality, pluralism and toleration. Highlighting the confusion over the first principle, Voltaire commented that "equality is at once the most natural and at times the most chimeral of things".[81] All forms of liberalism assume in some basic sense that individuals are equal.[82] In maintaining that people are naturally equal, liberals assume that they all possess the same right to liberty.[83] In other words, no one is inherently entitled to enjoy the benefits of liberal society more than anyone else and all people are equal subjects before the law.[84] Beyond this basic conception, liberal theorists diverge on their understanding of equality. American philosopher John Rawls emphasised the need to ensure not only equality under the law, but also the equal distribution of material resources that individuals required to develop their aspirations in life.[84] Libertarian thinker Robert Nozick disagreed with Rawls, championing the former version of Lockean equality instead.[84]
