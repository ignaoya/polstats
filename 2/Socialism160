Liberal socialism incorporates liberal principles to socialism.[485] It has been compared to post-war social democracy[486] for its support of a mixed economy that includes both public and private capital goods.[487][488] While democratic socialism and social democracy are anti-capitalist positions insofar as criticism of capitalism is linked to the private ownership of the means of production,[489] liberal socialism identifies artificial and legalistic monopolies to be the fault of capitalism[490] and opposes an entirely unregulated market economy.[491] It considers both liberty and social equality to be compatible and mutually dependent.[485]
