The Republican Civil War era program included free homestead farms, a federally subsidized transcontinental railroad, a national banking system, a large national debt, land grants for higher education, a new national banking system, a wartime income tax and permanent high tariffs to promote industrial growth and high wages. By the 1870s, they had adopted as well a hard money system based on the gold standard and fought off efforts to promote inflation through Free Silver.[37] They created the foundations of the modern welfare state through an extensive program of pensions for Union veterans.[38] Foreign-policy issues were rarely a matter of partisan dispute, but briefly in the 1893â€“1904 period the GOP supported imperialistic expansion regarding Hawaii, the Philippines and the Panama Canal.[39]
