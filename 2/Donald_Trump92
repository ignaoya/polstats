Trump scaled back the implementation of the ACA through Executive Orders 13765[303] and 13813.[304] Trump has expressed a desire to "let Obamacare fail"; his administration cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment.[305][306] The 2017 tax bill signed by Trump effectively repealed the ACA's individual health insurance mandate in 2019,[307] and a budget bill Trump signed in 2019 repealed the Cadillac plan tax, medical device tax, and tanning tax.[308][better source needed] As president, Trump falsely claimed he saved the coverage of pre-existing conditions provided by the ACA;[309] in fact, the Trump administration joined a lawsuit seeking to strike down the entire ACA, including protections for those with pre-existing conditions.[310][311] If successful, the lawsuit would eliminate health insurance coverage for up to 23 million Americans.[310] As a 2016 candidate, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs, but in January 2020 he suggested he was willing to consider cuts to such programs.[312]
