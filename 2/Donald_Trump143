On May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI director James Comey. He first attributed this action to recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein, which criticized Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails.[512] A few days later, Trump said he was concerned with the ongoing Trump-Russia investigations, and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier, regardless of DOJ advice.[513][514] According to a Comey memo of a private conversation in February, Trump said he "hoped" Comey would drop the investigation into National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.[515]
In March and April, Trump told Comey the ongoing suspicions formed a "cloud" impairing his presidency,[516] and asked him to publicly state that he was not personally under investigation.[517]
