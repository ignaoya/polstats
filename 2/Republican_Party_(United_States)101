As of 2020, Republican candidates had lost the popular vote in seven out of the last eight presidential elections.[327] Since 1992, the only time they won the popular vote in a presidential election is the 2004 United States presidential election. Demographers have pointed to the steady decline (as a percentage of the eligible voters) of its core base of older, less educated men.[328][329][330][331] However, Donald Trump managed to increase nonwhite support to 26% of his total votes in the 2020 election â€” the highest percentage for a GOP presidential candidate since 1960.[332][333]
