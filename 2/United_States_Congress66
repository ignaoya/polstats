A bill which reaches the floor of the full house can be simple or complex[113] and begins with an enacting formula such as "Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled." Consideration of a bill requires, itself, a rule which is a simple resolution specifying the particulars of debateâ€”time limits, possibility of further amendments, and such.[113] Each side has equal time and members can yield to other members who wish to speak.[113] Sometimes opponents seek to recommit a bill which means to change part of it.[113] Generally, discussion requires a quorum, usually half of the total number of representatives, before discussion can begin, although there are exceptions.[127] The house may debate and amend the bill; the precise procedures used by the House and Senate differ. A final vote on the bill follows.
