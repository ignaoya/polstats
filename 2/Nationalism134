Critics of nationalism have argued that it is often unclear what constitutes a nation, or whether a nation is a legitimate unit of political rule. Nationalists hold that the boundaries of a nation and a state should coincide with one another, thus nationalism tends to oppose multiculturalism.[211] It can also lead to conflict when more than one national group finds itself claiming rights to a particular territory or seeking to take control of the state.[4]
