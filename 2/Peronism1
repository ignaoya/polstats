Peronism[a], also called justicialism[b], is an Argentine political movement based on the ideas and legacy of Argentine president Juan Perón (1895–1974).[1] It has been an influential movement in 20th and 21st century Argentine politics.[1] Since 1946, Peronists won 10 out of the 13 presidential elections in which they have been allowed to run.[2] The main Peronist party is the Justicialist Party.[2] The policies of Peronist presidents have differed greatly,[2] but the general ideology has been described as "a vague blend of nationalism and labourism"[2] or populism.[1]
