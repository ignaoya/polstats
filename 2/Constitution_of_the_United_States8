Although, in a way, the Congressional powers in Article 9 made the "league of states as cohesive and strong as any similar sort of republican confederation in history",[16] the chief problem was, in the words of George Washington, "no money".[17] The Continental Congress could print money but it was worthless. Congress could borrow money, but couldn't pay it back.[17] No state paid all their U.S. taxes; some paid nothing. Some few paid an amount equal to interest on the national debt owed to their citizens, but no more.[17] No interest was paid on debt owed foreign governments. By 1786, the United States would default on outstanding debts as their dates came due.[17]
