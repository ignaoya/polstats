A Republican ticket of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney won the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections.[60] Bush campaigned as a "compassionate conservative" in 2000, wanting to better appeal to immigrants and minority voters.[61] The goal was to prioritize drug rehabilitation programs and aide for prisoner reentry into society, a move intended to capitalize on President Bill Clinton's tougher crime initiatives such as the 1994 crime bill passed under his administration. The platform failed to gain much traction among members of the party during his presidency.[62]
