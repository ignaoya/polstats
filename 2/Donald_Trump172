On May 17, 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, a former director of the FBI, to serve as special counsel for the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigating "links and/or coordination" between the Russian government and Trump's campaign and any matters directly arising from the investigation, taking over the existing "Crossfire Hurricane" FBI investigation.[636] The special counsel also investigated whether Trump's dismissal of James Comey as FBI director constituted obstruction of justice[637] and the Trump campaign's possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Israel, and China.[638]
