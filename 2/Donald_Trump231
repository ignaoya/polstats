Trump has been the subject of parody, comedy, and caricature. He has been parodied regularly on Saturday Night Live by Phil Hartman, Darrell Hammond, and Alec Baldwin and in South Park as Mr. Garrison. The Simpsons episode "Bart to the Future"—written during his 2000 campaign for the Reform Party—anticipated a Trump presidency. Trump's wealth and lifestyle had been a fixture of hip-hop lyrics since the 1980s; he was named in hundreds of songs, most often with a positive tone.[857] Mentions of Trump in hip-hop turned negative and pejorative after he ran for office in 2015.[857]
