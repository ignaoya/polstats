Anarchism advocates stateless societies often defined as self-governed voluntary institutions,[432][433][434][435] but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on non-hierarchical free associations.[436][437][438][439] While anarchism holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary or harmful,[440][441] it is not the central aspect.[442] Anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of human relations, including the state system.[436][443][444][445][446][447][448] Mutualists support market socialism, collectivist anarchists favour workers cooperatives and salaries based on the amount of time contributed to production, anarcho-communists advocate a direct transition from capitalism to libertarian communism and a gift economy and anarcho-syndicalists prefer workers' direct action and the general strike.[449]
