On 25 May 2014, the Spanish left-wing party Podemos entered candidates for the 2014 European parliamentary elections, some of which were unemployed. In a surprise result, it polled 7.98% of the vote and thus was awarded five seats out of 54[307][308] while the older United Left was the third largest overall force obtaining 10.03% and 5 seats, 4 more than the previous elections.[309]
