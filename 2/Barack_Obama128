On October 9, 2009, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize "for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples".[487] Obama accepted this award in Oslo, Norway on December 10, 2009, with "deep gratitude and great humility".[488] The award drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.[489][490][491][492] Obama's peace prize was called a "stunning surprise" by The New York Times.[493] Some neoconservatives praised his speech for what they viewed as pro-American content.[494][495] He became the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office.[496] Obama's Nobel Prize has been viewed skeptically in subsequent years, especially after the director of the Nobel Institute, Geir Lundestad, said Obama's Peace Prize did not have the desired effect of encouraging the president.[497]
