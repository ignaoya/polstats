When Obama and Biden won re-election in 2012, defeating a Mitt Romney-Paul Ryan ticket,[81] the  Republicans lost seven seats in the House in the November congressional elections, but still retained control of that chamber.[82] However, Republicans were not able to gain control of the Senate, continuing their minority status with a net loss of two seats.[83] In the aftermath of the loss, some prominent Republicans spoke out against their own party.[84][85][86] A post-2012 post-mortem report by the Republican Party concluded that the party needed to do more on the national level to attract votes from minorities and young voters.[87] In March 2013, National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus gave a stinging report on the party's electoral failures in 2012, calling on Republicans to reinvent themselves and officially endorse immigration reform. He said: "There's no one reason we lost. Our message was weak; our ground game was insufficient; we weren't inclusive; we were behind in both data and digital, and our primary and debate process needed improvement." He proposed 219 reforms that included a $10Â million marketing campaign to reach women, minorities and gays as well as setting a shorter, more controlled primary season and creating better data collection facilities.[88]
