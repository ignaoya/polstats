Anarchists are split in this domain, depending on whether they believe that a majority-rule is tyrannic or not.  To many anarchists, the only form of democracy considered acceptable is direct democracy. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon argued that the only acceptable form of direct democracy is one in which it is recognised that majority decisions are not binding on the minority, even when unanimous.[192] However, anarcho-communist Murray Bookchin criticised individualist anarchists for opposing democracy,[193] and says "majority rule" is consistent with anarchism.[194]
