Article III describes the court system (the judicial branch), including the Supreme Court.  The article describes the kinds of cases the court takes as original jurisdiction.  Congress can create lower courts and an appeals process, and enacts law defining crimes and punishments.  Article Three also protects the right to trial by jury in all criminal cases, and defines the crime of treason.
