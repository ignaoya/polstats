Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56Â km) from Islamabad.[430] CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.[430] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a "surgical raid" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs.[430] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.[431][432] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse,[433] which was buried at sea several hours later.[434] Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's Ground Zero and Times Square.[431][435] Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.[436]
