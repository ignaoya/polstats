In Russia, exploitation of nationalist sentiments allowed Vladimir Putin to consolidate power.[107] This nationalist sentiment was used in Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and other actions in Ukraine.[103] Nationalist movements gradually began to rise in Central Europe as well, particularly Poland, under the influence of the ruling party, Law and Justice (led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski).[108] In Hungary, the anti-immigration rhetoric and stance against foreign influence is a powerful national glue promoted the ruling Fidesz party (led by Viktor Orb√°n).[109] Nationalist parties have also joined governing coalitions in Bulgaria,[110] Slovakia,[111] Latvia[112] and Ukraine.[113]
