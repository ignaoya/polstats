American philosopher and historian Hans Kohn wrote in 1944 that nationalism emerged in the 17th century.[24] Other sources variously place the beginning in the 18th century during revolts of American states against Spain or with the French Revolution. The consensus is that nationalism as a concept was firmly established by the 19th century.[25][26][27]
