Research suggests Trump's rhetoric caused an increased incidence of hate crimes.[849][850][851] During the 2016 campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters.[852][853] Since then, some defendants prosecuted for hate crimes or violent acts cited Trump's rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should receive a lighter sentence.[854] In May 2020, a nationwide review by ABC News identified at least 54 criminal cases from August 2015 to April 2020 in which Trump was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence by mostly white men against mostly members of minority groups.[855] On January 13, 2021, the House of Representatives impeached Trump for incitement of insurrection for his actions prior to the storming of the U.S. Capitol by a violent mob of his supporters[733] who acted in his name.[856]
