In October 2016, two days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 "hot mic" recording surfaced in which Trump was heard bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying "when you're a star, they let you do it, you can do anything ... grab 'em by the pussy."[917] The incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during the campaign[918] and caused outrage across the political spectrum.[919]
