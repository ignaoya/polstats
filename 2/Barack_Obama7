Obama was born on August 4, 1961,[5] at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii.[6][7][8] He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states.[9] He was born to an American mother of European descent and an African father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas; she was mostly of English descent,[10] with some German, Irish, Scottish,[11][12][13][14][15] Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.[16] In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century.[17][18] Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr. (1936–1982),[19] was a married[20][21][22] Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo.[20][23] Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.[24][25] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.[26][27]
