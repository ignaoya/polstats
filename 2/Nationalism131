Territorial nationalists assume that all inhabitants of a particular nation owe allegiance to their country of birth or adoption.[200] A sacred quality is sought in the nation and in the popular memories it evokes. Citizenship is idealized by territorial nationalists. A criterion of a territorial nationalism is the establishment of a mass, public culture based on common values, codes and traditions of the population.[201]
