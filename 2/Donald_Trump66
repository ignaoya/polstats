According to Michael Barkun, the Trump campaign was remarkable for bringing fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream.[217] During his presidential campaign, Trump was accused of pandering to white supremacists.[218] He retweeted racist Twitter accounts,[219] and repeatedly refused to condemn David Duke, the Ku Klux Klan or white supremacists.[220] Duke enthusiastically supported Trump and said he and like-minded people voted for Trump because of his promises to "take our country back".[221][222] After repeated questioning by reporters, Trump said he disavowed Duke and the Klan.[223]
