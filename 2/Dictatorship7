Military dictatorships are regimes in which a group of officers holds power, determines who will lead the country, and exercises influence over policy. High-level elites and a leader are the members of the military dictatorship. Military dictatorships are characterized by rule by a professionalized military as an institution. In military regimes, elites are referred to as junta members, who are typically senior officers (and often other high-level officers) in the military.[10][12] This type of dictatorship was imposed during the 20th century in countries such as,  Chile by Augusto Pinochet,  Argentina by Jorge Rafael Videla and other leaders,  Uruguay by Juan Maria Bordaberry,  Paraguay by Alfredo Stroessner, Bolivia by Hugo Banzer,  Brazil by Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco.
