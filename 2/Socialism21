Syndicalism emerged in France inspired in part by Proudhon and later by Pelloutier and Georges Sorel.[108] It developed at the end of the 19th century out of the French trade-union movement (syndicat is the French word for trade union). It was a significant force in Italy and Spain in the early 20th century until it was crushed by the fascist regimes in those countries. In the United States, syndicalism appeared in the guise of the Industrial Workers of the World, or "Wobblies", founded in 1905.[108] Syndicalism is an economic system that organises industries into confederations (syndicates)[109] and the economy is managed by negotiation between specialists and worker representatives of each field, comprising multiple non-competitive categorised units.[110] Syndicalism is a form of communism and economic corporatism, but also refers to the political movement and tactics used to bring about this type of system. An influential anarchist movement based on syndicalist ideas is anarcho-syndicalism.[111] The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions.
