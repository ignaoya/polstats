The Republican Party is generally associated with social conservative policies, although it does have dissenting centrist and libertarian factions. The social conservatives support laws that uphold their traditional values, such as opposition to same-sex marriage, abortion, and marijuana.[182] Most conservative Republicans also oppose gun control, affirmative action, and illegal immigration.[182][183]
