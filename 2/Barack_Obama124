Obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator.[463] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.[464] In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors,[465][466] but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era.[467]
