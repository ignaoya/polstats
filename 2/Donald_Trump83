Trump is a skeptic of trade liberalization, adopting these views in the 1980s, and sharply criticized NAFTA during the Republican primary campaign in 2015.[269][270][271] He withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations,[272] imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports,[273] and launched a trade war with China by sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50 billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S.[274][275] On several occasions, Trump said incorrectly that these import tariffs are paid by China into the U.S. Treasury.[276] Although Trump pledged during his 2016 campaign to significantly reduce the U.S.'s large trade deficits, the U.S. trade deficit reached its highest level in 12 years under his administration.[277] Following a 2017â€“2018 renegotiation, Trump signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) as the successor to NAFTA on January 29, 2020.[278] The revised trade deal became effective on July 1, 2020.[279]
