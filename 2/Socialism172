Eco-socialism is a political strain merging aspects of socialism, Marxism or libertarian socialism with green politics, ecology and alter-globalisation. Eco-socialists generally claim that the expansion of the capitalist system is the cause of social exclusion, poverty, war and environmental degradation through globalisation and imperialism under the supervision of repressive states and transnational structures.[549] Contrary to the depiction of Karl Marx by some environmentalists,[550] social ecologists[551] and fellow socialists[552] as a productivist who favoured the domination of nature, eco-socialists revisited Marx's writings and believe that he "was a main originator of the ecological world-view".[553] Marx discussed a "metabolic rift" between man and nature, stating that "private ownership of the globe by single individuals will appear quite absurd as private ownership of one man by another" and his observation that a society must "hand it [the planet] down to succeeding generations in an improved condition".[554] English socialist William Morris is credited with developing principles of what was later called eco-socialism.[555] During the 1880s and 1890s, Morris promoted his ideas within the Social Democratic Federation and Socialist League.[556] Green anarchism blends anarchism with environmental issues. An important early influence was Henry David Thoreau and his book Walden[557] as well as Élisée Reclus.[558][559]
