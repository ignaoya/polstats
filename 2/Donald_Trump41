From 1996 to 2015, Trump owned all or part of the Miss Universe pageants, including Miss USA and Miss Teen USA.[132][133] Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002.[134][135] In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe.[136] After NBC and Univision dropped the pageants from their broadcasting lineups in June 2015,[137] Trump bought NBC's share of the Miss Universe Organization and sold the entire company to the William Morris talent agency.[132]
