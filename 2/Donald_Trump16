Trump has often said he began his career with "a small loan of one million dollars" from his father, and that he had to pay it back with interest.[51] In October 2018, The New York Times reported that Trump "was a millionaire by age 8," borrowed at least $60 million from his father, largely failed to repay those loans, and had received $413 million (adjusted for inflation) from his father's business empire over his lifetime.[52][53] According to the report, Trump and his family committed tax fraud, which a lawyer for Trump denied. The tax department of New York said it is investigating.[54][55] Trump's investments underperformed the stock market and the New York property market.[56][57] Forbes estimated in October 2018 that the value of Trump's personal brand licensing business had declined by 88 percent since 2015, to $3 million.[58]
