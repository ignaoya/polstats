Modern Republicans advocate the theory of supply-side economics, which holds that lower tax rates increase economic growth.[141] Many Republicans oppose higher tax rates for higher earners, which they believe are unfairly targeted at those who create jobs and wealth. They believe private spending is more efficient than government spending. Republican lawmakers have also sought to limit funding for tax enforcement and tax collection.[142]
