Political culture describes how culture impacts politics. Every political system is embedded in a particular political culture.[63] Lucian Pye's definition is that "Political culture is the set of attitudes, beliefs, and sentiments, which give order and meaning to a political process and which provide the underlying assumptions and rules that govern behavior in the political system".[63]
