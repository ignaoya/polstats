Many of Trump's comments and actions have been considered racist.[810] He has repeatedly denied this, asserting: "I am the least racist person there is anywhere in the world."[811] In national polling, about half of Americans say that Trump is racist; a greater proportion believe that he has emboldened racists.[812][813][814] Several studies and surveys have found that racist attitudes fueled Trump's political ascendance and have been more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters.[815][816] Racist and Islamophobic attitudes are a strong indicator of support for Trump.[817]
