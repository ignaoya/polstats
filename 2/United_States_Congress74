In 1971, the cost of running for Congress in Utah was $70,000[135] but costs have climbed.[136] The biggest expense is television advertisements.[51][131][135][137][138] Today's races cost more than a million dollars for a House seat, and six million or more for a Senate seat.[6][51][137][139][140] Since fundraising is vital, "members of Congress are forced to spend ever-increasing hours raising money for their re-election."[attribution needed][141]
