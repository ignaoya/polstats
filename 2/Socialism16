West European social critics, including Louis Blanc, Charles Fourier, Charles Hall, Robert Owen, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Saint-Simon were the first modern socialists who criticised the poverty and inequality of the Industrial Revolution. They advocated reform, Owen advocating the transformation of society to small communities without private property. Owen's contribution to modern socialism was his claim that individual actions and characteristics were largely determined by their social environment.[99] On the other hand, Fourier advocated Phalanst√®res (communities that respected individual desires, including sexual preferences), affinities and creativity and saw that work has to be made enjoyable for people.[100] Owen and Fourier's ideas were practiced in intentional communities around Europe and North America in the mid-19th century.
