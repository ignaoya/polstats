Due to the Industrial Revolution, there was an emergence of an integrated, nation-encompassing economy and a national public sphere, where the British people began to identify with the country at large, rather than the smaller units of their province, town or family. The early emergence of a popular patriotic nationalism took place in the mid-18th century, and was actively promoted by the British government and by the writers and intellectuals of the time.[30] National symbols, anthems, myths, flags and narratives were assiduously constructed by nationalists and widely adopted. The Union Jack was adopted in 1801 as the national one.[31] Thomas Arne composed the patriotic song "Rule, Britannia!" in 1740,[32] and the cartoonist John Arbuthnot invented the character of John Bull as the personification of the English national spirit in 1712.[33]
