Trump repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored,[581] such as approving unproven treatments[595][596] or speeding up the approval of vaccines.[596] Trump administration political appointees at HHS sought to control CDC communications to the public that undermined Trump's claims that the pandemic was under control. CDC resisted many of the changes, but increasingly allowed HHS personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication.[597][598] Trump alleged without evidence that FDA scientists were part of a "deep state" opposing him, and delaying approval of vaccines and treatments to hurt him politically.[599]
