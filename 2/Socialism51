From 1946 to 1962, the Norwegian Labour Party held an absolute majority in the parliament led by Einar Gerhardsen, who remained Prime Minister for seventeen years. Although the party abandoned most of its pre-war socialist ideas, the welfare state was expanded under Gerhardsen to ensure the universal provision of basic human rights and stabilise the economy.[177] In the 1945 Norwegian parliamentary election, the Communist Party took 12% of the votes, but it largely vanished during the Cold War.[178] In the 1950s, popular socialism emerged in Nordic countries. It placed itself between communism and social democracy.[179] In the early 1960s, the Socialist Left Party challenged the Labour Party from the left.[176] Also in the 1960s, Gerhardsen established a planning agency and tried to establish a planned economy.[177] In the 1970s, a more radical socialist party, the Worker's Communist Party (AKP), broke from the Socialist Left Party and had notable influence in student associations and some trade unions. The AKP identified with Communist China and Albania rather than the Soviet Union.[180]
