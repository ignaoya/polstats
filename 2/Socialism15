The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a meritocratic or technocratic society based on individual talent.[97] Henri de Saint-Simon was fascinated by the potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism based on equal opportunities.[98][unreliable source?] He sought a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work.[97] His key focus was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was essential to progress.[99] This was accompanied by a desire for a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific and material progress.[97] Other early socialist thinkers such as Charles Hall and Thomas Hodgkin based their ideas on David Ricardo's economic theories. They reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated prices charged by the producer when those commodities were in elastic supply and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labourâ€”the cost of the labour (essentially the wages paid) that was required to produce the commodities. The Ricardian socialists viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value.[citation needed]
