According to the Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68 percent approval rating[468] before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41 percent in August 2010,[469] a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office.[470] He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously.[471][472] His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52 percent shortly after his second inauguration.[473] Despite approval ratings dropping to 39 percent in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50 percent in January 2015 according to Gallup.[474]
