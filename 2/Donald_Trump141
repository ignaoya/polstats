The Trump administration had a high turnover of personnel, particularly among White House staff. By the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.[502] As of early July 2018[update], 61 percent of Trump's senior aides had left[503] and 141 staffers had left in the previous year.[504] Both figures set a record for recent presidents – more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years.[505] Notable early departures included National Security Advisor Michael Flynn (after just 25 days in office), and Press Secretary Sean Spicer.[505] Close personal aides to Trump including Steve Bannon, Hope Hicks, John McEntee, and Keith Schiller quit or were forced out.[506] Some, like Hicks and McEntee, later returned to the White House in different posts.[507] Trump publicly disparaged several of his former top officials, calling them incompetent, stupid, or crazy.[508]
