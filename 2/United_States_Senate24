However, in five states, different methods are used. In Georgia, a runoff between the top two candidates occurs if the plurality winner in the general election does not also win a majority. In Washington, California, and Louisiana, a nonpartisan blanket primary (also known as a "jungle primary" or "top-two primary") is held in which all candidates participate in a single primary regardless of party affiliation and the top two candidates in terms of votes received at the primary election advance to the general election, where the winner is the candidate with the greater number of votes. In Louisiana, the blanket primary is considered the general election and the winner of the blanket primary can win the overall election if he or she received a majority of the vote, skipping the run-off. In Maine, following two ballot initiatives in 2016 and 2018, ranked-choice voting is used to nominate and elect candidates for federal offices, including the Senate. Alaska voted in November 2020 to adopt a system with a nonpartisan blanket primary from which four candidates would advance to a general election in which ranked-choice voting would be used.[19]
