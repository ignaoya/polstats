Political opponents maintain that Per贸n and his administration resorted to organised violence and dictatorial rule; that Per贸n showed contempt for any opponents, and regularly characterised them as traitors and agents of foreign powers. Per贸n subverted freedoms by nationalising the broadcasting system, centralising the unions under his control and monopolising the supply of newspaper print. At times, Per贸n also resorted to tactics such as illegally imprisoning opposition politicians and journalists, including Radical Civic Union leader Ricardo Balbin; and shutting down opposition papers, such as La Prensa.
