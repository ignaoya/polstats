Starting in spring 2020, Trump began to sow doubts about the election, repeatedly claiming without evidence that the election would be "rigged"[690] and that the expected widespread use of mail balloting would produce "massive election fraud."[691][692] On July 30, Trump raised the idea of delaying the election.[693] When in August the House of Representatives voted for a US$25 billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service for the expected surge in mail voting, Trump blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail.[694] Trump became the Republican nominee on August 24, 2020.[695] He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and commit to a peaceful transition of power if he lost.[696][697]
