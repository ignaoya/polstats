After the 2016 elections, Republicans maintained a majority in the Senate, House, state governorships and wielded newly acquired executive power with the ascension of Trump to the presidency. The Republican Party controlled 69 of 99 state legislative chambers in 2017, the most it had held in history;[100] and at least 33 governorships, the most it had held since 1922.[101] The party had total control of government (legislative chambers and governorship) in 25 states,[102][103] the most since 1952;[104] the opposing Democratic Party had full control in only five states.[105] Following the results of the 2018 midterm elections, the Republicans lost control of the House yet maintained hold of the Senate.[106]
