The Trump administration separated more than 5,400 children of migrant families from their parents at the U.S.â€“Mexico border while attempting to enter the U.S, a sharp increase in the number of family separations at the border starting from the summer of 2017.[371][372] In April 2018, the Trump administration announced a "zero tolerance" policy whereby every adult suspected of illegal entry would be criminally prosecuted.[373] This resulted in family separations, as the migrant adults were put in criminal detention for prosecution, while their children were separated as unaccompanied alien minors.[374] Administration officials described the policy as a way to deter illegal immigration.[375]
