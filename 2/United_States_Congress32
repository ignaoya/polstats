Congress has an important role in national defense, including the exclusive power to declare war, to raise and maintain the armed forces, and to make rules for the military.[72] Some critics charge that the executive branch has usurped Congress's constitutionally defined task of declaring war.[73] While historically presidents initiated the process for going to war, they asked for and received formal war declarations from Congress for the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War, the Spanish–American War, World War I, and World War II,[74] although President Theodore Roosevelt's military move into Panama in 1903 did not get congressional approval.[74] In the early days after the North Korean invasion of 1950, President Truman described the American response as a "police action."[75] According to Time magazine in 1970, "U.S. presidents [had] ordered troops into position or action without a formal congressional declaration a total of 149 times."[74] In 1993, Michael Kinsley wrote that "Congress's war power has become the most flagrantly disregarded provision in the Constitution," and that the "real erosion [of Congress's war power] began after World War II."[76][77][78] Disagreement about the extent of congressional versus presidential power regarding war has been present periodically throughout the nation's history.[79]
