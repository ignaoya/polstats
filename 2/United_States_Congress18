Government powerlessness led to the Convention of 1787 which proposed a revised constitution with a two–chamber or bicameral congress.[13] Smaller states argued for equal representation for each state.[14] The two-chamber structure had functioned well in state governments.[15] A compromise plan, the Connecticut Compromise, was adopted with representatives chosen by population (benefiting larger states) and exactly two senators chosen by state governments (benefiting smaller states).[6][16] The ratified constitution created a federal structure with two overlapping power centers so that each citizen as an individual was subjected to both the power of state government and the national government.[17][18][19] To protect against abuse of power, each branch of government—executive, legislative, and judicial—had a separate sphere of authority and could check other branches according to the principle of the separation of powers.[2] Furthermore, there were checks and balances within the legislature since there were two separate chambers.[20] The new government became active in 1789.[2][21]
