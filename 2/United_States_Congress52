Committees write legislation. While procedures, such as the House discharge petition process, can introduce bills to the House floor and effectively bypass committee input, they are exceedingly difficult to implement without committee action. Committees have power and have been called independent fiefdoms. Legislative, oversight, and internal administrative tasks are divided among about two hundred committees and subcommittees which gather information, evaluate alternatives, and identify problems.[118] They propose solutions for consideration by the full chamber.[118] In addition, they perform the function of oversight by monitoring the executive branch and investigating wrongdoing.[118]
