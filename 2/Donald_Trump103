Trump's proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter and contentious debate during the campaign. He promised to build a wall on the Mexicoâ€“United States border to restrict illegal movement and vowed Mexico would pay for it.[348] He pledged to deport millions of illegal immigrants residing in the United States,[349] and criticized birthright citizenship for incentivizing "anchor babies."[350] As president, he frequently described illegal immigration as an "invasion" and conflated immigrants with the criminal gang MS-13, though research shows undocumented immigrants have a lower crime rate than native-born Americans.[351]
