Socialism is a political, social, and economic philosophy encompassing a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership of the means of production.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] It includes the political theories and movements associated with such systems.[9] Social ownership can be public, collective, cooperative, or of equity.[10] While no single definition encapsulates the many types of socialism,[11] social ownership is the one common element.[1][12][13] Socialists disagree about the degree to which social control or regulation of the economy is necessary, how far society should intervene and whether government, particularly existing government, is the correct vehicle for change.[14]
