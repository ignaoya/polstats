In 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.[81] Trump converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues and used a wing of the house as a private residence.[82] In 2019, Trump declared Mar-a-Lago his primary residence,[75] although under a 1993 agreement with the Town of Palm Beach, Trump may spend no more than three weeks per year there.[83]
