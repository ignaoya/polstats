Perón became Argentina's labour secretary after participating in the 1943 military coup and was elected president of Argentina in 1946.[1][3] He introduced social programs that benefited the working class,[4] supported labor unions and called for additional involvement of the state in the economy.[1] In addition, he helped industrialists.[2] Perón was hugely popular and gained even more admiration through his wife Eva, who championed for the rights of migrant workers and was beloved by the people.[5] Eva was so beloved that in 1949 Juan Perón formed the Female Peronist Party, a new wing within his own party under her leadership.[6] Due to rising inflation and other economic problems, the military overthrew Perón in 1955.[7] The Peronist party was banned[7] and it was not until 1973 that open elections were held again in which Perón was again elected president.[1]
