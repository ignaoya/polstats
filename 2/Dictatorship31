The often-cited exploitative dictatorship is the regime of Mobutu Sese Seko, who ruled Zaire from 1965 to 1997, embezzling over $5 billion from his country.[36] Pakistan is another country to have been governed by 3 military dictators for almost 32 years in 7 decades of its existence. Starting with General Muhammad Ayub Khan who ruled from 1958–1969. Next was General Zia-ul-Haq who usurped power in 1977 and held on to power the longest until he died in an air crash in 1988. Ten years after Zia, General Pervez Musharraf got control after defeat against India in the Kargil war. He remained in power for 9 years until 2008.[37] Suharto of Indonesia is another prime example, having embezzled $15-35 billion[38][39] during his 31-year dictatorship known as the New Order. In the Philippines, the conjugal dictatorship[40] of Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos embezzled billions of dollars in public funds,[41][42][43] while the nation's foreign debt skyrocketed from $599 million in 1966 to $26.7 billion in 1986, with debt payment being reachable only by 2025.[44] The Marcos dictatorship has been noted for its anti-Muslim killings,[45][46][47][48] political repression, censorship, and human rights violations,[49] including various methods of torture.[50]
