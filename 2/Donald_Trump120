As a presidential candidate, Trump promised to construct a wall along the U.S.â€“Mexico border to prevent migration.[403] In 2017, the border had 654 miles of primary fencing, 37 miles of secondary fencing and 14 miles of tertiary fencing.[404] Trump's target, from 2015 to 2017, was 1,000 miles of wall.[405] The Trump administration set a target of 450 miles of new or renovated barriers by December 2020, with an ultimate goal of 509 miles of new or renovated barriers by August 2021.[406] Even into 2020, Trump repeatedly provided false assertions that Mexico was paying for the Trump wall, although American taxpayers were footing the bill from funds being diverted from the U.S. Department of Defense.[407]
