Despite being offered a full scholarship to Northwestern University School of Law, Obama enrolled at Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts.[114] He was selected as an editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year,[115] president of the journal in his second year,[109][116] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years.[117] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990.[118] After graduating with a JD degree magna cum laude[119] from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.[115] Obama's election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention[109][116] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,[120] which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.[120]
