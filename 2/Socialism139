The Marxian economist Richard D. Wolff argues that "re-organising production so that workers become collectively self-directed at their work-sites" not only moves society beyond both capitalism and state socialism of the last century, but would also mark another milestone in human history, similar to earlier transitions out of slavery and feudalism.[410] As an example, Wolff claims that Mondragon is "a stunningly successful alternative to the capitalist organisation of production".[411]
