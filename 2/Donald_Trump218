As president, Trump privately and publicly mused about revoking the press credentials of journalists he views as critical.[802] His administration moved to revoke the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts.[803] In 2019, a member of the foreign press reported many of the same concerns as those of media in the U.S., expressing concern that a normalization process by reporters and media results in an inaccurate characterization of Trump.[804] The Trump White House held about a hundred formal press briefings in 2017, declining by half during 2018 and to two in 2019.[803]
