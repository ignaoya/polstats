In 1982, Trump was listed on the initial Forbes list of wealthy individuals as having a share of his family's estimated $200 million net worth. His financial losses in the 1980s caused him to be dropped from the list between 1990 and 1995.[43] In its 2020 billionaires ranking, Forbes estimated Trump's net worth at $2.1 billion[c] (1,001st in the world),[46] making him one of the richest politicians in American history and the first billionaire American president.[46] Forbes estimated that his net worth declined 31 percent and his ranking fell 138 spots between 2015 and 2018.[47] When he filed mandatory financial disclosure forms with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) in July 2015, Trump claimed a net worth of about $10 billion;[48] however, FEC figures cannot corroborate this estimate because they only show each of his largest buildings as being worth over $50 million, yielding total assets worth more than $1.4 billion and debt of more than $265 million.[49]
