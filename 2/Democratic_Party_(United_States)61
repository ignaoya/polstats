Equal economic opportunity, a social safety net, and strong labor unions have historically been at the heart of Democratic economic policy.[22] Democrats support a progressive tax system, higher minimum wages, Social Security, universal health care, public education, and subsidized housing.[22] They also support infrastructure development and clean energy investments to achieve economic development and job creation.[137] Since the 1990s, the party has at times supported centrist economic reforms that cut the size of government and reduced market regulations.[138] The party has generally rejected both laissez-faire economics and market socialism, instead favoring Keynesian economics within a capitalist market-based system.[139]
