In 1992, Trump, his siblings Maryanne, Elizabeth, and Robert, and his cousin John W. Walter, each with a 20 percent share, formed All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump's rental units and then billing those services and supplies to Trump Management with markups of 20â€“50 percent and more. The proceeds generated by the markups were shared by the owners.[53][131] The increased costs were used as justification to get state approval for increasing the rents of Trump's rent-stabilized units.[53]
