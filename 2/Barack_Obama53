The inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq.[217] He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp,[218] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds[219][220][221] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries.[222] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.[223] He also revoked President George W. Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City policy prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.[224]
