In 2006, then-California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger broke from Republican orthodoxy to sign several bills imposing caps on carbon emissions in California. Then-President George W. Bush opposed mandatory caps at a national level. Bush's decision not to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant was challenged in the Supreme Court by 12 states,[154] with the court ruling against the Bush administration in 2007.[155] Bush also publicly opposed ratification of the Kyoto Protocols[150][156] which sought to limit greenhouse gas emissions and thereby combat climate change; his position was heavily criticized by climate scientists.[157]
