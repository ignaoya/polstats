Trump often refused to wear a face mask at public events, contrary to his own administration's April 2020 guidance that Americans should wear masks in public[590] and despite nearly unanimous medical consensus that masks are important to preventing the spread of the virus.[591] By June, Trump had said masks were a "double-edged sword"; ridiculed Biden for wearing masks; continually emphasized that mask-wearing was optional; and suggested that wearing a mask was a political statement against him personally.[591] Trump's contradiction of medical recommendations weakened national efforts to mitigate the pandemic.[590][591]
