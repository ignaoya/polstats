During the 2016 presidential election campaign, American Media, Inc. (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer,[609] and a company set up by Trump's attorney Michael Cohen paid Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stormy Daniels for keeping silent about their alleged affairs with Trump between 2006 and 2007.[610] Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to breaking campaign finance laws, saying he had arranged both payments at the direction of Trump to influence the presidential election.[611] Trump denied the affairs and claimed he was not aware of Cohen's payment to Daniels, but he reimbursed him in 2017.[612][613] Federal prosecutors asserted that Trump had been involved in discussions regarding non-disclosure payments as early as 2014.[614] Court documents showed that the FBI believed Trump was directly involved in the payment to Daniels, based on calls he had with Cohen in October 2016.[615][616] Federal prosecutors closed the investigation,[617] but the Manhattan District Attorney subpoenaed the Trump Organization and AMI for records related to the payments[618] and Trump and the Trump Organization for eight years of tax returns.[619]
