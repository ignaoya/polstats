Anti-colonial nationalism is an intellectual framework that preceded, accompanied and followed the process of decolonization in the mid-1900s. Benedict Anderson defined a nation as a socially constructed community that is co-created by individuals who imagine themselves as part of this group.[154] He points to the New World as the cite of nationalism, which is defined by its imagination of an ahistorical identity that negates colonialism by definition.
