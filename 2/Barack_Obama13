After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College on a full scholarship. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid.[51] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks.[51] Later in 1981, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City as a junior, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations[52] and in English literature[53] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.[54] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1983 and a 3.7 GPA. After graduating, Obama worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer,[55][56] then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.[57][58][59]
