The notion of democracy has evolved over time considerably,[2]
and, generally, the two current types of democracy are direct and representative. In a direct democracy, the people directly deliberate and decide on legislation. In a representative democracy, the people elect representatives to deliberate and decide on legislation, such as in parliamentary or presidential democracy.[3] Liquid democracy combines elements of these two basic types.
