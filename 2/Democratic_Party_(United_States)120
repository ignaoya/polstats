The young have voted in favor of the Democratic presidential candidate in every election since Bill Clinton in 1992 and are more likely to identify as liberals than the general population.[238] In the 2004 presidential election, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry received 54% of the vote from voters of the age group 18â€“29 while Republican George W. Bush received 45%. In the 2006 midterm elections, the Democrats received 60% of the vote from the same age group.[93][94]
