In May 2018, Trump announced the U.S.' unilateral departure from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear deal negotiated with the U.S., Iran, and five other world powers in 2015.[445] After withdrawing from the agreement, the Trump administration applied a policy of "maximum pressure" on Iran via economic sanctions, without support of other parties to the deal.[446][447] The Trump State Department certified Iran's compliance with the deal in July 2017, but Iran began breaching its terms in May 2020, and by September the IAEA reported the country had ten times the amount of enriched uranium allowed under the deal.[448][449][450] In  mid-2020 the United States attempted to "snap back" pre-deal sanctions by asserting to the UN Security Council that it remained a participant in the deal, without significant international support.[451]
