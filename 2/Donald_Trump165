By July 2020, Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic became a major issue for the 2020 presidential election.[603] Democratic challenger Joe Biden sought to make the election a referendum on Trump's performance on the COVID-19 pandemic and the economy.[604] Polls indicated voters blamed Trump for his pandemic response[603] and disbelieved his rhetoric concerning the virus, with an Ipsos/ABC News poll indicating 65 percent of Americans disapproving of his pandemic response.[605] In the final months of the campaign, Trump repeatedly claimed that the U.S. was "rounding the turn" in managing the pandemic, despite increasing numbers of reported cases and deaths.[606] A few days before the November 3 election, the United States reported more than 100,000 cases in a single day for the first time.[607]
