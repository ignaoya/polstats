Support for the war among the American people has diminished over time and many Democrats have changed their opinion and now oppose a continuation of the conflict.[214][215] In July 2008, Gallup found that 41% of Democrats called the invasion a "mistake" while a 55% majority disagreed. In contrast, Republicans were more supportive of the war. The survey described Democrats as evenly divided about whether or not more troops should be sentâ€”56% support it if it would mean removing troops from Iraq and only 47% support it otherwise.[215] A CNN survey in August 2009 stated that a majority of Democrats now oppose the war. CNN polling director Keating Holland said: "Nearly two thirds of Republicans support the war in Afghanistan. Three quarters of Democrats oppose the war".[214] An August 2009 Washington Post poll found similar results and the paper stated that Obama's policies would anger his closest supporters.[216]
