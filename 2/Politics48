Trust is a major factor in political culture, as its level determines the capacity of the state to function.[64] Postmaterialism is the degree to which a political culture is concerned with issues which are not of immediate physical or material concern, such as human rights and environmentalism.[63] Religion has also an impact on political culture.[64]
