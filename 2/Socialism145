The current economic system in China is formally referred to as a socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics. It combines a large state sector that comprises the commanding heights of the economy, which are guaranteed their public ownership status by law,[420] with a private sector mainly engaged in commodity production and light industry responsible from anywhere between 33%[421] to over 70% of GDP generated in 2005.[422] Although there has been a rapid expansion of private-sector activity since the 1980s, privatisation of state assets was virtually halted and were partially reversed in 2005.[423] The current Chinese economy consists of 150 corporatised state-owned enterprises that report directly to China's central government.[424] By 2008, these state-owned corporations had become increasingly dynamic and generated large increases in revenue for the state,[425][426] resulting in a state-sector led recovery during the 2009 financial crises while accounting for most of China's economic growth.[427] However, the Chinese economic model is widely cited as a contemporary form of state capitalism, the major difference between Western capitalism and the Chinese model being the degree of state-ownership of shares in publicly listed corporations.
