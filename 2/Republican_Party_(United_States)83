Fr√©mont, received almost no votes in the South. This trend continued into the 20th century. Following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Southern states became more reliably Republican in presidential politics, while Northeastern states became more reliably Democratic.[263][264][265][266][267][268][269][270] Studies show that Southern whites shifted to the Republican Party due to racial conservatism.[269][271][272]
