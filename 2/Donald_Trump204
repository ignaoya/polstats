Globally, a Gallup poll on 134 countries comparing the approval ratings of U.S. leadership between the years 2016 and 2017 found that only in 29 of them did Trump lead Obama in job approval,[753] with more international respondents disapproving rather than approving of the Trump administration. Overall ratings were similar to those in the last two years of the George W. Bush presidency.[754] Only 16 percent of international respondents expressed confidence in Trump by mid-2020, according to a 13-nation Pew Research poll; a score lower than those of Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping.[755]
