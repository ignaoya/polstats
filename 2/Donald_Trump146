Trump appointed more than 200 federal judges who were confirmed by the Senate.[523][524] Senate Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, rapidly confirmed Trump's judicial appointees, usually against unified Democratic opposition, shifting the federal judiciary to the right.[524][525] The appointees were overwhelmingly white men and younger on average than the appointees of Trump's predecessors.[525] Many are affiliated with the Federalist Society.[525][526]
