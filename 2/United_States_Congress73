Nevertheless, incumbent members of Congress running for reelection have strong advantages over challengers.[47] They raise more money[52] because donors fund incumbents over challengers, perceiving the former as more likely to win,[50][131] and donations are vital for winning elections.[132] One critic compared being elected to Congress to receiving life tenure at a university.[131] Another advantage for representatives is the practice of gerrymandering.[133][134] After each ten-year census, states are allocated representatives based on population, and officials in power can choose how to draw the congressional district boundaries to support candidates from their party.  As a result, reelection rates of members of Congress hover around 90 percent,[7] causing some critics to accuse them of being a privileged class.[6] Academics such as Princeton's Stephen Macedo have proposed solutions to fix gerrymandering in the U.S. Both senators and representatives enjoy free mailing privileges, called franking privileges; while these are not intended for electioneering, this rule is often skirted by borderline election-related mailings during campaigns.
