The Republicans experienced electoral success in the wave election of 2010, which coincided with the ascendancy of the Tea Party movement,[72][73][74][75] a fiscally conservative political movement. Members of the movement called for lower taxes, and for a reduction of the national debt of the United States and federal budget deficit through decreased government spending.[76][77] It was also described as a popular constitutional movement[78] composed of a mixture of libertarian, right-wing populist, and conservative activism. That success began with the upset win of Scott Brown in the Massachusetts special Senate election for a seat that had been held for decades by the Democratic Kennedy brothers.[79] In the November elections, Republicans recaptured control of the House, increased their number of seats in the Senate and gained a majority of governorships.[80]
