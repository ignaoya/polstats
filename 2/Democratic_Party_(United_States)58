Progressives are the most left-leaning faction in the party and support strong business regulations, social programs, and workers' rights.[109][110] Progressive ideological stances have much in common with the programs of European social-democratic parties. Many progressive Democrats are descendants of the New Left of Democratic presidential candidate Senator George McGovern of South Dakota whereas others were involved in the 2016 presidential candidacy of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Progressives are often considered to be synonymous with liberals, though progressives are sometimes considered to show stronger support for universal health care, solutions for economic inequality, and environmental regulations.[111]
