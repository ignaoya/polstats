Before being inaugurated, Trump moved his businesses into a revocable trust run by his sons, Eric and Donald Jr, and a business associate.[255][256] However Trump continued to profit from his businesses[257] and continued to have knowledge of how his administration's policies affected his businesses.[256] Though Trump said he would eschew "new foreign deals," the Trump Organization pursued expansions of its operations in Dubai, Scotland, and the Dominican Republic.[257]
