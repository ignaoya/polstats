In 1945, the British Labour Party led by Clement Attlee was elected based on a radical socialist programme. The Labour government nationalised industries including mines, gas, coal, electricity, rail, iron, steel and the Bank of England. British Petroleum was officially nationalised in 1951.[166] Anthony Crosland said that in 1956 25% of British industry was nationalised and that public employees, including those in nationalised industries, constituted a similar proportion of the country's workers.[167] The Labour Governments of 1964–1970 and 1974–1979 intervened further.[168] It re-nationalised British Steel (1967) after the Conservatives had denationalised it and nationalised British Leyland (1976).[169] The National Health Service provided taxpayer-funded health care to everyone, free at the point of service.[170] Working-class housing was provided in council housing estates and university education became available via a school grant system.[171]
