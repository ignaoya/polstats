Carroll Quigley concludes that the characteristics of weapons are the main predictor of democracy:[220][221] Democracy—this scenario—tends to emerge only when the best weapons available are easy for individuals to obtain and use.[222] By the 1800s, guns were the best personal weapons available, and in the United States of America (already nominally democratic), almost everyone could afford to buy a gun, and could learn how to use it fairly easily. Governments couldn't do any better: it became the age of mass armies of citizen soldiers with guns.[222] Similarly, Periclean Greece was an age of the citizen soldier and democracy.[223]
