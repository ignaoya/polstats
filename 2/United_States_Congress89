From 1789 to 1815, members of Congress received only a daily payment of $6 while in session. Members received an annual salary of $1,500 per year from 1815 to 1817, then a per diem salary of $8 from 1818 to 1855; since then they have received an annual salary, first pegged in 1855 at $3,000.[179][180] In 1907, salaries were raised to $7,500 per year, the equivalent of $173,000 in 2010.[180] In 2006, members of Congress received a yearly salary of $165,200.[180] Congressional leaders were paid $183,500 per year. The Speaker of the House of Representatives earns $212,100 annually. The salary of the President pro tempore for 2006 was $183,500, equal to that of the majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate.[181] Privileges include having an office and paid staff.[126] In 2008, non-officer members of Congress earned $169,300 annually.[154] Some critics complain congressional pay is high compared with a median American income of $45,113 for men and $35,102 for women.[182] Others have countered that congressional pay is consistent with other branches of government.[154] Another criticism is that members of Congress have access to free or low-cost medical care in the Washington, D.C., area. The petition, "Remove health-care subsidies for Members of Congress and their families," garnered over 1,077,000 signatures on the website Change.org.[183] In January 2014, it was reported that for the first time over half of the members of Congress were millionaires.[184] Congress has been criticized for trying to conceal pay raises by slipping them into a large bill at the last minute.[185] Others have criticized the wealth of members of Congress.[135][138] Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee told Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig that a chief problem with Congress was that members focused on lucrative careers as lobbyists after serving––that Congress was a "Farm League for K Street"––instead of on public service.[186][187]
