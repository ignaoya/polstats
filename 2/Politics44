Some political philosophies consider the state undesirable, and thus consider the formation of a stateless society a goal to be achieved. A central tenet of anarchism is the advocacy of society without states.[55][59] The type of society sought for varies significantly between anarchist schools of thought, ranging from extreme individualism to complete collectivism.[60] In Marxism, Marx's theory of the state considers that in a post-capitalist society the state, an undesirable institution, would be unnecessary and wither away.[61] A related concept is that of stateless communism, a phrase sometimes used to describe Marx's anticipated post-capitalist society.
