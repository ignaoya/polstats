Opposing factions led by Henry Clay helped form the Whig Party. The Democratic Party had a small yet decisive advantage over the Whigs until the 1850s, when the Whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery. In 1854, angry with the Kansasâ€“Nebraska Act, anti-slavery Democrats left the party and joined Northern Whigs to form the Republican Party.[39][40]
