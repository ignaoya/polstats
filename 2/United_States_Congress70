The House reserves roll-call votes for the most formal matters, as a roll call of all 435 representatives takes quite some time; normally, members vote by using an electronic device. In the case of a tie, the motion in question fails. Most votes in the House are done electronically, allowing members to vote yea or nay or present or open.[2] Members insert a voting ID card and can change their votes during the last five minutes if they choose; in addition, paper ballots are used on some occasionsâ€”yea indicated by green and nay by red.[2] One member cannot cast a proxy vote for another.[2] Congressional votes are recorded on an online database.[128][129]
