Fixer Roy Cohn served as Trump's lawyer and mentor for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s.[104][105] According to Trump, Cohn sometimes waived fees due to their friendship.[65] In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the United States government for $100 million over its charges that Trump's properties had racial discriminatory practices. Trump and Cohn lost that case when the countersuit was dismissed and the government's case went forward.[106] In 1975 an agreement was struck requiring Trump's properties to furnish the New York Urban League with a list of all apartment vacancies, every week for two years, among other things.[107] Cohn introduced political consultant Roger Stone to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government.[108]
