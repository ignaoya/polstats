In the late 20th century, the media became more important in Congress's work.[59] Analyst Michael Schudson suggested that greater publicity undermined the power of political parties and caused "more roads to open up in Congress for individual representatives to influence decisions."[59] Norman Ornstein suggested that media prominence led to a greater emphasis on the negative and sensational side of Congress, and referred to this as the tabloidization of media coverage.[6] Others saw pressure to squeeze a political position into a thirty-second soundbite.[60] A report characterized Congress in 2013 as being unproductive, gridlocked, and "setting records for futility."[61] In October 2013, with Congress unable to compromise, the government was shut down for several weeks and risked a serious default on debt payments, causing 60% of the public to say they would "fire every member of Congress" including their own representative.[62] One report suggested Congress posed the "biggest risk to the U.S. economy" because of its brinksmanship, "down-to-the-wire budget and debt crises" and "indiscriminate spending cuts," resulting in slowed economic activity and keeping up to two million people unemployed.[63] There has been increasing public dissatisfaction with Congress,[64] with extremely low approval ratings[65][66] which dropped to 5% in October 2013.[67]
