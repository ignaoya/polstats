On January 11, 2021, an article of impeachment charging Trump with incitement of insurrection against the U.S. government was introduced to the House.[732] The House voted 232–197 to impeach Trump on January 13, making him the first U.S. officeholder to be impeached twice.[733]  The impeachment, which was the most rapid in history, followed an unsuccessful bipartisan effort to strip Trump of his powers and duties via Section 4 of the 25th Ammendment.[734] Ten Republicans voted for impeachment – the most members of a party ever to vote to impeach a president of their own party.[735]
