Trump has written up to 19 books on business, financial, or political topics, though he has used ghostwriters to do this.[160] Trump's first book, The Art of the Deal (1987), was a New York Times Best Seller. While Trump was credited as co-author, the entire book was ghostwritten by Tony Schwartz.[161] According to The New Yorker, "The book expanded Trump's renown far beyond New York City, making him an emblem of the successful tycoon."[161] Trump has called the book his second favorite, after the Bible.[162]
