Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s.[68] He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.[68][69] The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.[69]
