As the voting franchise in the United Kingdom was increased, it also was made more uniform in a series of reforms that began with the Reform Act 1832 and continued into the 20th century, notably with the Equal Franchise Act 1928. Universal male suffrage was established in France in March 1848 in the wake of the French Revolution of 1848.[104] In 1848, several revolutions broke out in Europe as rulers were confronted with popular demands for liberal constitutions and more democratic government.[105]
