The Democratic Party receives support from secular organizations such as the Secular Coalition for America[279] and many agnostic and atheist Americans. Exit polls from the 2008 election showed that voters with a religious affiliation of "none" accounted for the 12% of the electorate and voted for Obama by a 75â€“25% margin.[280] In his first inaugural address, Obama acknowledged atheists by saying that the United States is not just "Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus but non-believers as well".[281] In the 2012 election cycle, Obama had moderate to high ratings with the Secular Coalition for America while the majority of the Republican candidates had ratings in the low-to-failing range.[282] In 2020 United States presidential election, exit polls show that voters with religious affiliation of "none" accounted for 22% of the electorate and voted for Biden by a 65-31% margin.[283]
