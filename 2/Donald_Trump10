Trump went to Sunday school and was confirmed in 1959 at the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens.[27][28] In the 1970s, his parents joined the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, which belongs to the Reformed Church.[27][29] The pastor at Marble, Norman Vincent Peale,[27] ministered to Trump's family until Peale's death in 1993.[29] Trump has described Peale as a mentor.[30] In 2015, after Trump said he attends Marble, the church stated he "is not an active member" of the church.[28] In November 2019, Trump appointed his personal pastor, televangelist Paula White, to the White House Office of Public Liaison.[31] In October 2020, Trump said that he identified as a non-denominational Christian.[32]
