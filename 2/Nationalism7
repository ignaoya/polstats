Nationalism as derived from the noun designating 'nations' is a newer word; in English the term dates from 1844, although the concept is older.[21] It became important in the 19th century.[22] The term increasingly became negative in its connotations after 1914. Glenda Sluga notes that "The twentieth century, a time of profound disillusionment with nationalism, was also the great age of globalism."[23]
