As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights.[548] In 2010, he signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, which brought an end to "don't ask, don't tell" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from LGB people; the law went into effect the following year.[549] In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.[550][241] A Gallup poll, taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68 percent of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress in the situation for gays and lesbians during Obama's eight years in office.[551]
