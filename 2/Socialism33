The Constituent Assembly elected SR leader Victor Chernov President of a Russian republic, but rejected the Bolshevik proposal that it endorse the Soviet decrees on land, peace and workers' control and acknowledge the power of the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies. The next day, the Bolsheviks declared that the assembly was elected on outdated party lists[130] and the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the Soviets dissolved it.[131][132] In March 1919, world communist parties formed Comintern (also known as the Third International) at a meeting in Moscow.[133]
