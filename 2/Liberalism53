The New Liberalism or social liberalism movement emerged about 1900 in Britain.[136] The New Liberals, which included intellectuals like L. T. Hobhouse and John A. Hobson, saw individual liberty as something achievable only under favorable social and economic circumstances.[137] In their view, the poverty, squalor and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. New Liberals believed that these conditions could be ameliorated only through collective action coordinated by a strong, welfare-oriented and interventionist state.[138] It supports a mixed economy that includes both public and private property in capital goods.[139][140]
