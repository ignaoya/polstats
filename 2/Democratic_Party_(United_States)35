In the early 20th century, the traditional symbol of the Democratic Party in Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Ohio was the rooster, as opposed to the Republican eagle. This symbol still appears on Oklahoma, Kentucky, Indiana, and West Virginia ballots.[79] The rooster was adopted as the official symbol of the national Democratic Party.[80] In New York, the Democratic ballot symbol is a five-pointed star.[81]
