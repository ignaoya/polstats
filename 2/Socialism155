Social democracy is a socialist tradition of political thought.[462][463] Many social democrats refer to themselves as socialists or democratic socialists and some such as Tony Blair employ these terms interchangeably.[464][465][466] Others found "clear differences" between the three terms and prefer to describe their own political beliefs by using the term social democracy.[467] The two main directions were to establish democratic socialism or to build first a welfare state within the capitalist system. The first variant advances democratic socialism through reformist and gradualist methods.[468] In the second variant, social democracy is a policy regime involving a welfare state, collective bargaining schemes, support for publicly financed public services and a mixed economy. It is often used in this manner to refer to Western and Northern Europe during the later half of the 20th century.[469][470] It was described by Jerry Mander as "hybrid economics", an active collaboration of capitalist and socialist visions.[471] Numerous studies and surveys indicate that people tend to live happier lives in social democratic societies rather than neoliberal ones.[472][473][474][475]
