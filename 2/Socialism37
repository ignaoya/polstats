The Russian Revolution influenced uprisings in other countries. The German Revolution of 1918â€“1919 replaced Germany's imperial government with a republic. The revolution lasted from November 1918 until the establishment of the Weimar Republic in August 1919. It included an episode known as the Bavarian Soviet Republic[146][147][148][149] and the Spartacist uprising. In Italy, the events known as the Biennio Rosso[150][151] were characterised by mass strikes, worker demonstrations and self-management experiments through land and factory occupations. In Turin and Milan, workers' councils were formed and many factory occupations took place led by anarcho-syndicalists organised around the Unione Sindacale Italiana.[152]
