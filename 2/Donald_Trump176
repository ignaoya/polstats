The Mueller report's second volume set forth ten "episodes" of potential obstruction of justice by Trump, but opted not to make any "traditional prosecutorial judgment" on whether Trump broke the law, suggesting that Congress should make such a determination.[654][655] Investigators decided they could not "apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes" as an Office of Legal Counsel opinion stated that a sitting president could not be indicted, and investigators would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court.[656] The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, "may apply the obstruction laws."[657] The House of Representatives subsequently launched an impeachment inquiry following the Trumpâ€“Ukraine scandal, but did not pursue an article of impeachment related to the Mueller investigation.[658][659]
