Obama was an early opponent of the George W. Bush administration's 2003 invasion of Iraq.[146] On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War,[147] Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago anti-Iraq War rally,[148] and spoke out against the war.[149] He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd "it's not too late" to stop the war.[150]
