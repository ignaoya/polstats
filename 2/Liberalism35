Smith assumed that workers could be paid as low as was necessary for their survival, which was later transformed by David Ricardo and Thomas Robert Malthus into the "iron law of wages".[91] His main emphasis was on the benefit of free internal and international trade, which he thought could increase wealth through specialisation in production.[92] He also opposed restrictive trade preferences, state grants of monopolies and employers' organisations and trade unions.[93] Government should be limited to defence, public works and the administration of justice, financed by taxes based on income.[94] Smith was one of the progenitors of the idea, which was long central to classical liberalism and has resurfaced in the globalisation literature of the later 20th and early 21st centuries, that free trade promotes peace.[95] Smith's economics was carried into practice in the 19th century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the Poor Relief Act that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the East India Company over India in 1858.[96]
