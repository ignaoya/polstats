On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois.[184][185] The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic because it was also where Abraham Lincoln delivered his historic "House Divided" speech in 1858.[184][186] Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the Iraq War, increasing energy independence, and reforming the health care system,[187] in a campaign that projected themes of hope and change.[188]
