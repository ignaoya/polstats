Since members of Congress must advertise heavily on television, this usually involves negative advertising, which smears an opponent's character without focusing on the issues.[145] Negative advertising is seen as effective because "the messages tend to stick."[146] However, these advertisements sour the public on the political process in general as most members of Congress seek to avoid blame.[147] One wrong decision or one damaging television image can mean defeat at the next election, which leads to a culture of risk avoidance, a need to make policy decisions behind closed doors,[147][148] and concentrating publicity efforts in the members' home districts.[59]
