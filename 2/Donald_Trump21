Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal. The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged by Fred Trump,[69] who also joined Hyatt in guaranteeing $70 million in bank construction financing.[70][71] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel,[72] and that same year, Trump obtained rights to develop Trump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[73] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Organization and was Trump's primary residence until 2019.[74][75]
