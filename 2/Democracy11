No consensus exists on how to define democracy â€“ indeed, one study found that at least 2,234 descriptions of democracy exist in the English language[15] - but legal equality, political freedom and rule of law have been identified as important characteristics.[16][17] These principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes.[citation needed] For example, in a representative democracy, every vote has equal weight, no unreasonable restrictions can apply to anyone seeking to become a representative,[according to whom?] and the freedom of its eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights and liberties which are typically protected by a constitution.[18][19] Other uses of "democracy" include that of direct democracy.
