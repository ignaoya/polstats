To enforce judicial decisions, the Constitution grants federal courts both criminal contempt and civil contempt powers.  Other implied powers include injunctive relief and the habeas corpus remedy.  The Court may imprison for contumacy, bad-faith litigation, and failure to obey a writ of mandamus. Judicial power includes that granted by Acts of Congress for rules of law and punishment. Judicial power also extends to areas not covered by statute. Generally, federal courts cannot interrupt state court proceedings.[51]
