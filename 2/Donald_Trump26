Trump acquired a third casino in Atlantic City, the Trump Taj Mahal, in 1988 in a highly leveraged transaction.[88] It was financed with $675 million in junk bonds and completed at a cost of $1.1 billion, opening in April 1990.[89][90][91] The project went bankrupt the following year,[90] and the reorganization left Trump with only half his initial ownership stake and required him to pledge personal guarantees of future performance.[92] Facing "enormous debt," he gave up control of his money-losing airline, Trump Shuttle, and sold his megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been indefinitely docked in Atlantic City while leased to his casinos for use by wealthy gamblers.[93][94]
