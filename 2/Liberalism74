Fascists accuse liberalism of materialism and a lack of spiritual values.[200] In particular, fascism opposes liberalism for its materialism, rationalism, individualism and utilitarianism.[201] Fascists believe that the liberal emphasis on individual freedom produces national divisiveness,[200] but many fascists agree with liberals in their support of private property rights and a market economy.[201]
