In 2005 and 2006, Obama criticized certain aspects of the Patriot Act for infringing too much on civil liberties and sought as Senator to strengthen civil liberties protections.[345][346][347] In 2006, he voted to reauthorize a revised version of the Patriot Act, saying the law was not ideal but that the revised version had strengthened civil liberties.[347] In 2011, he signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act.[348] Following the 2013 global surveillance disclosures by whistleblower Edward Snowden, Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic,[346] but called for increased restrictions on the NSA to address violations of privacy.[349][350] The changes which Obama ordered have been described as "modest" however.[351]
