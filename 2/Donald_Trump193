At 2 a.m. the morning after the election, with the results still unclear, Trump declared victory.[707] After Biden was projected the winner days later, Trump said, "this election is far from over" and baselessly alleged election fraud.[708] Trump and his allies filed many legal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both the state and federal courts, including by federal judges appointed by Trump himself, finding no factual or legal basis.[709][710] Trump's unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voting fraud were also refuted by state election officials.[711] After Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) director Chris Krebs contradicted Trump's fraud allegations, Trump dismissed him on November 17.[712] On December 11, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case from the Texas attorney general which asked the court to overturn the election results in four states won by Biden.[713]
