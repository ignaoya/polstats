Monetarists believe the most significant factor influencing inflation or deflation is how fast the money supply grows or shrinks. They consider fiscal policy, or government spending and taxation, as ineffective in controlling inflation.[53] The monetarist economist Milton Friedman famously stated, "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon."[54]
