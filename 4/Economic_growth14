Increases in labor productivity (the ratio of the value of output to labor input) have historically been the most important source of real per capita economic growth.[10][11][12][13][14] "In a famous estimate, MIT Professor Robert Solow concluded that technological progress has accounted for 80 percent of the long-term rise in U.S. per capita income, with increased investment in capital explaining only the remaining 20 percent."[15]
