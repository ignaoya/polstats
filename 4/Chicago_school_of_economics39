James M. Buchanan (1919â€“2013) won the 1986 Nobel Prize in Economics for his public choice theory.[67] He studied under Frank H. Knight at the University of Chicago, receiving PhD in 1948. Although he did not hold any position at the university afterwards, his later work is closely related to the thought of the Chicago school. Buchanon was the foremost proponent of the Virginia school of political economy.
