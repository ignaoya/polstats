Adam Smith resided at Panmure House from 1778 to 1790. This residence has now been purchased by the Edinburgh Business School at Heriot-Watt University and fundraising has begun to restore it.[127][128] Part of the Northern end of the original building appears to have been demolished in the 19th century to make way for an iron foundry.
