Keynes had completed his A Treatise on Probability before the war but published it in 1921.[32] The work was a notable contribution to the philosophical and mathematical underpinnings of probability theory, championing the important view that probabilities were no more or less than truth values intermediate between simple truth and falsity. Keynes developed the first upper-lower probabilistic interval approach to probability in chapters 15 and 17 of this book, as well as having developed the first decision weight approach with his conventional coefficient of risk and weight, c, in chapter 26. In addition to his academic work, the 1920s saw Keynes active as a journalist selling his work internationally and working in London as a financial consultant. In 1924 Keynes wrote an obituary for his former tutor
Alfred Marshall which Joseph Schumpeter called "the most brilliant life of a man of science I have ever read."[36]
Marshall's widow was "entranced" by the memorial, while Lytton Strachey rated it as one of Keynes's "best works".[32]
