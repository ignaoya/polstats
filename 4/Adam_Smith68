Smith has been celebrated by advocates of free-market policies as the founder of free-market economics, a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the Adam Smith Institute in London, multiple entities known as the "Adam Smith Society", including an historical Italian organization,[129] and the U.S.-based Adam Smith Society,[130][131] and the Australian Adam Smith Club,[132] and in terms such as the Adam Smith necktie.[133]
