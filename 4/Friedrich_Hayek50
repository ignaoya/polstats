Hayek's first class at Chicago was a faculty seminar on the philosophy of science attended by many of the University of Chicago's most notable scientists of the time, including Enrico Fermi, Sewall Wright and Leó Szilárd. During his time at Chicago, he worked on the philosophy of science, economics, political philosophy and the history of ideas. His economics notes from this period have yet to be published. Hayek received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1954.[67]
