In Britain by the 16th century the putting-out system, by which farmers and townspeople produced goods for market in their homes, often described as cottage industry, was being practiced.  Typical putting out system goods included spinning and weaving.  Merchant capitalists typically provided the raw materials, paid workers by the piece, and were responsible for the sale of the goods.  Embezzlement of supplies by workers and poor quality were common problems.  The logistical effort in procuring and distributing raw materials and picking up finished goods were also limitations of the putting out system.[104]
