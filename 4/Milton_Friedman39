Although Friedman concluded the government does have a role in the monetary system[77] he was critical of the Federal Reserve due to its poor performance and felt it should be abolished.[78][79][80] He was opposed to Federal Reserve policies, even during the so-called 'Volcker shock' that was labeled 'monetarist'.[81] Friedman believed that the Federal Reserve System should ultimately be replaced with a computer program.[82] He favored a system that would automatically buy and sell securities in response to changes in the money supply.[83]
