Econometrician David Hendry criticized part of Friedman's and Anna Schwartz's 1982 Monetary Trends.[154] When asked about it during an interview with Icelandic TV in 1984,[155] Friedman said that the criticism referred to a different problem from that which he and Schwartz had tackled, and hence was irrelevant,[156] and pointed out the lack of consequential peer review amongst econometricians on Hendry's work.[157] In 2006, Hendry said that Friedman was guilty of "serious errors" of misunderstanding that meant "the t-ratios he reported for UK money demand were overstated by nearly 100 per cent", and said that, in a paper published in 1991 with Neil Ericsson,[158] he had refuted "almost every empirical claim ... made about UK money demand" by Friedman and Schwartz.[159] A 2004 paper updated and confirmed the validity of the Hendryâ€“Ericsson findings through 2000.[160]
