In 1766, Henry Scott's younger brother died in Paris, and Smith's tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter.[42] Smith returned home that year to Kirkcaldy, and he devoted much of the next decade to writing his magnum opus.[43] There, he befriended Henry Moyes, a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude.  Smith secured the patronage of David Hume and Thomas Reid in the young man's education.[44] In May 1773, Smith was elected fellow of the Royal Society of London,[45] and was elected a member of the Literary Club in 1775. The Wealth of Nations was published in 1776 and was an instant success, selling out its first edition in only six months.[46]
