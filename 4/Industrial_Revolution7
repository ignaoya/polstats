The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and social changes.[15][16][17][18] Eric Hobsbawm held that the Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s,[15] while T. S. Ashton held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830.[16] Rapid industrialization first began in Britain, starting with mechanized spinning in the 1780s,[19] with high rates of growth in steam power and iron production occurring after 1800. Mechanized textile production spread from Great Britain to continental Europe and the United States in the early 19th century, with important centres of textiles, iron and coal emerging in Belgium and the United States and later textiles in France.[1]
