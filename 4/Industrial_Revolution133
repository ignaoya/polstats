The growth of modern industry since the late 18th century led to massive urbanisation and the rise of new great cities, first in Europe and then in other regions, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas.  In 1800, only 3% of the world's population lived in cities,[138] compared to nearly 50% today (the beginning of the 21st century).[139] Manchester had a population of 10,000 in 1717, but by 1911 it had burgeoned to 2.3Â million.[140]
