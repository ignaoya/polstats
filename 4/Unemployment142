In the US, the Works Progress Administration (1935â€“43) was the largest make-work program. It hired men (and some women) off the relief roles ("dole") typically for unskilled labor.[140]
During the New Deal, over three million unemployed young men were taken out of their homes and placed for six months into more than 2600 work camps managed by the Civilian Conservation Corps.[141]
