Some scholars argue that the capitalist approach to environmental economics does not take into consideration the preservation of natural resources[254] and that capitalism creates three ecological problems: growth, technology, and consumption.[255] The growth problem results from the nature of capitalism, as it focuses around the accumulation of capital.[255] The innovation of new technologies has an impact on the environmental future as they serve as a capitalist tool in which environmental technologies can result in the expansion of the system.[256] Consumption is focused around the capital accumulation of commodities and neglects the use-value of production.[255]
