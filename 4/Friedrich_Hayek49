Although they shared most political beliefs, disagreeing primarily on question of monetary policy,[65] Hayek and Friedman worked in separate university departments with different research interests and never developed a close working relationship.  Despite their occasional social interaction they were not personally close.  According Alan O. Ebenstein, who wrote biographies of both of them, Hayek probably had a closer friendship with Keynes than with Friedman.[66]
