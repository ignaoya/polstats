In 1547, a bill was passed that subjected vagrants to some of the more extreme provisions of the criminal law: two years' servitude and branding with a "V" as the penalty for the first offense and death for the second.[127] During the reign of Henry VIII, as many as 72,000 people are estimated to have been executed.[128] In the 1576 Act, each town was required to provide work for the unemployed.[129]
