A growing consumer culture also saw people start to spend more money on entertainment. Increased literacy rates, industrialisation, and the invention of railway, created a new market for cheap popular literature for the masses and the ability for it to be circulated on a large scale. Penny dreadfuls were created in the 1830s to meet this demand.[130] The Guardian described penny dreadfuls as "Britain's first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young", and "the Victorian equivalent of video games".[131] More than one million boys' periodicals were sold per week.[131]
