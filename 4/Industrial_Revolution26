In 1764 in the village of Stanhill, Lancashire, James Hargreaves invented the spinning jenny, which he patented in 1770. It was the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles.[44] The jenny worked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel, by first clamping down on the fibres, then by drawing them out, followed by twisting.[45] It was a simple, wooden framed machine that only cost about £6 for a 40-spindle model in 1792,[46] and was used mainly by home spinners. The jenny produced a lightly twisted yarn only suitable for weft, not warp.[43]:825–27
