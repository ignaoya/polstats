In his 1955 article "The Role of Government in Education"[91] Friedman proposed supplementing publicly operated schools with privately run but publicly funded schools through a system of school vouchers.[92] Reforms similar to those proposed in the article were implemented in, for example, Chile in 1981 and Sweden in 1992.[93] In 1996, Friedman, together with his wife, founded the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice to advocate school choice and vouchers. In 2016, the Friedman Foundation changed its name to EdChoice to honor the Friedmans' desire to have the educational choice movement live on without their names attached to it after their deaths.[15]
