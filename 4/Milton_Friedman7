Friedman graduated in 1932, and initially intended to become an actuary. But he was offered two scholarships to do graduate work, one in mathematics at Brown University and the other in economics at the University of Chicago.[28] Friedman chose the latter, earning a Master of Arts degree in 1933. He was strongly influenced by Jacob Viner, Frank Knight, and Henry Simons. Friedman met his future wife, economist Rose Director, while at the University of Chicago.[29]
