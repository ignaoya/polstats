In 1950, Hayek left the London School of Economics. After spending the 1949â€“1950 academic year as a visiting professor at the University of Arkansas, Hayek was brought on[clarification needed] by the University of Chicago, where he became a professor in the Committee on Social Thought. Hayek's salary was funded not by the university, but by an outside foundation, the William Volker Fund.
