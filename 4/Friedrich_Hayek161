After divorce, for a time, Hayek rarely visited his children, but continued more regular contact with them in his older age, after moving to Europe.[215][219]  Hayek's son, Laurence Hayek (1934â€“2004) was a distinguished microbiologist.[220] His daughter Christine was an entomologist at the British Museum of Natural History, and she cared for him during his last years of declining health.[219][221]
