There are also different ways national statistical agencies measure unemployment. The differences may limit the validity of international comparisons of unemployment data.[32] To some degree, the differences remain despite national statistical agencies increasingly adopting the definition of unemployment of the International Labour Organization.[33] To facilitate international comparisons, some organizations, such as the OECD, Eurostat, and International Labor Comparisons Program, adjust data on unemployment for comparability across countries.
