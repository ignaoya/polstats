A connection between inflation and unemployment has been drawn since the emergence of large scale unemployment in the 19th century, and connections continue to be drawn today. However, the unemployment rate generally only affects inflation in the short-term but not the long-term.[51] In the long term, the velocity of money is far more predictive of inflation than low unemployment.[52]
