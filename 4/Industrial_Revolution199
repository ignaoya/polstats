One question of active interest to historians is why the Industrial Revolution occurred in Europe and not in other parts of the world in the 18th century, particularly China, India, and the Middle East (which pioneered in shipbuilding, textile production, water mills, and much more in the period between 750 and 1100[213]), or at other times like in Classical Antiquity[214] or the Middle Ages.[215] A recent account argued that Europeans have been characterized for thousands of years by a freedom-loving culture originating from the aristocratic societies of early Indo-European invaders.[216] Many historians, however, have challenged this explanation as being not only Eurocentric, but also ignoring historical context. In fact, before the Industrial Revolution, "there existed something of a global economic parity between the most advanced regions in the world economy."[217] These historians have suggested a number of other factors, including education, technological changes[218] (see Scientific Revolution in Europe), "modern" government, "modern" work attitudes, ecology, and culture.[219]
