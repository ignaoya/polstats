Wage labour refers to the sale of labour under a formal or informal employment contract to an employer.[142] These transactions usually occur in a labour market where wages are market determined.[143] Individuals who possess and supply financial capital to productive ventures often become owners, either jointly (as shareholders) or individually.[citation needed] In Marxist economics, these owners of the means of production and suppliers of capital are generally called capitalists. The description of the role of the capitalist has shifted, first referring to a useless intermediary between producers, then to an employer of producers, and finally to the owners of the means of production.[83] Labor includes all physical and mental human resources, including entrepreneurial capacity and management skills, which are needed to produce products and services. Production is the act of making goods or services by applying labor power.[144][145]
