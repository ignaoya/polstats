Idealistically, Friedman actually favored the principles of the 1930s Chicago plan, which would have ended fractional reserve banking and, thus, private money creation.  It would force banks to have 100% reserves backing deposits, and instead place money creation powers solely in the hands of the US Government.  This would make targeting money growth more possible, as endogenous money created by fractional reserve lending would no longer be a major issue.[84]
