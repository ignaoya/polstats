Germany's total war damage was estimated at about 17.5% of the pre-war total capital stock by value, i.e. about 1/6. In the Berlin area alone, there were 8 million refugees lacking basic necessities. In 1945, less than 10% of the railways were still operating. 2,395 rail bridges had been destroyed (out of a total of 7,500 bridges) along with 10,000 locomotives and more than 100,000 goods wagons. Less than 40% of the remaining locomotives were operational.
