Economic growth in the United States slowed down after 1973.[33] In contrast growth in Asia has been strong since then, starting with Japan and spreading to Four Asian Tigers, China, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent and Asia Pacific.[34] In 1957 South Korea had a lower per capita GDP than Ghana,[35] and by 2008 it was 17 times as high as Ghana's.[36] The Japanese economic growth has slackened considerably since the late 1980s.
