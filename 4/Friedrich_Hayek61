Hayek gained some controversy in 1978 by praising Thatcher's anti-immigration policy proposal in an article which ignited numerous accusations of anti-Semitism and racism because of his reflections on the inability of assimilation of Eastern European Jews in the Vienna of his youth.[85]  He defended himself by explaining that he made no racial judgements, only highlighted the problems of acculturation.[86]
