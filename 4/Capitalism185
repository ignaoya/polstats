Market failure occurs when an externality is present and a market will often either under-produce a product with a positive externalisation or overproduce a product that generates a negative externalisation.[citation needed] Air pollution is a negative externalisation that cannot be easily incorporated into markets as the world's air is not owned and then sold for use to polluters.[citation needed] So too much pollution could be emitted and people not involved in the production pay the cost of the pollution instead of the firm that initially emitted the air pollution.[citation needed] Critics of market failure theory such as Ronald Coase, Harold Demsetz and James M. Buchanan argue that government programs and policies also fall short of absolute perfection.[citation needed] While all nations currently have some kind of market regulations, the desirable degree of regulation is disputed.[citation needed]
