Among Keynes's Bloomsbury friends, Lopokova was, at least initially, subjected to criticism for her manners, mode of conversation, and supposedly humble social origins â€“ the last of the ostensible causes being particularly noted in the letters of Vanessa and Clive Bell, and Virginia Woolf.[159][160] In her novel Mrs Dalloway (1925), Woolf bases the character of Rezia Warren Smith on Lopokova.[161] E. M. Forster later wrote in contrition about "Lydia Keynes, every whose word should be recorded":[162] "How we all used to underestimate her".[159]
