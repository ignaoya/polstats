The Habsburg realms which became Austria-Hungary in 1867 included 23 million inhabitants in 1800, growing to 36 million by 1870, second only to Russia in population. The population was overwhelmingly rural.  Nationally the per capita rate of industrial growth averaged about 3% between 1818 and 1870. However there were strong regional differences.  The railway system was built in the 1850-1873 period. Before they arrived transportation was very slow and expensive.  In the Alpine and Bohemian regions, proto-industrialization at begun by 1750, and became the center of the first phases of the industrial revolution after 1800. The textile industry was the main factor, utilizing mechanization, steam engines, and the factory system. Much of machinery was purchased from the British. In the Bohemian regions, machine spinning started later and only became a major factor by 1840. Bohemia's resources were successfully exploited, growing 10% a year. The iron industry had developed in the Alpine regions after 1750, with smaller centers in Bohemia and Moravia. Hungaryâ€”the eastern half of the Dual Monarchy, was heavily rural with little industry before 1870.[186]
