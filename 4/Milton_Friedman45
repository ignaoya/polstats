Biographer Lanny Ebenstein noted a drift over time in Friedman's views from an interventionist to a more cautious foreign policy.[98] He supported US involvement in the Second World War and initially supported a hard-line against Communism, but moderated over time.[98] However, Friedman did state in a 1995 interview that he was an anti-interventionist.[99] He opposed the Gulf War and the Iraq War.[98] In a spring 2006 interview, Friedman said that the US's stature in the world had been eroded by the Iraq War, but that it might be improved if Iraq were to become a peaceful and independent country.[100]
