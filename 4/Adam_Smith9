Smith entered the University of Glasgow when he was 14 and studied moral philosophy under Francis Hutcheson.[17] Here, he developed his passion for liberty, reason, and free speech. In 1740, he was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at Balliol College, Oxford, under the Snell Exhibition.[18]
