The rapid population growth in the 19th century included the new industrial and manufacturing cities, as well as service centers such as Edinburgh and London.[117] The critical factor was financing, which was handled by building societies that dealt directly with large contracting firms.[118][119] Private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure. P. Kemp says this was usually of advantage to tenants.[120] People moved in so rapidly there was not enough capital to build adequate housing for everyone, so low-income newcomers squeezed into increasingly overcrowded slums. Clean water, sanitation, and public health facilities were inadequate; the death rate was high, especially infant mortality, and tuberculosis among young adults. Cholera from polluted water and typhoid were endemic. Unlike rural areas, there were no famines such as the one that devastated Ireland in the 1840s.[121][122][123]
