The neoclassical interest in Smith's statement about "an invisible hand" originates in the possibility of seeing it as a precursor of neoclassical economics and its concept of general equilibrium â€“ Samuelson's "Economics" refers six times to Smith's "invisible hand". To emphasise this connection, Samuelson[94] quotes Smith's "invisible hand" statement substituting "general interest" for "public interest". Samuelson[95] concludes: "Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s, no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market."
