Steam engines made the use of higher-pressure and volume blast practical; however, the leather used in bellows was expensive to replace. In 1757, iron master John Wilkinson patented a hydraulic powered blowing engine for blast furnaces.[55] The blowing cylinder for blast furnaces was introduced in 1760 and the first blowing cylinder made of cast iron is believed to be the one used at Carrington in 1768 that was designed by John Smeaton.[36]:124, 135  Cast iron cylinders for use with a piston were difficult to manufacture; the cylinders had to be free of holes and had to be machined smooth and straight to remove any warping.  James Watt had great difficulty trying to have a cylinder made for his first steam engine.  In 1774 John Wilkinson, who built a cast iron blowing cylinder for his iron works, invented a precision boring machine for boring cylinders. After Wilkinson bored the first successful cylinder for a Boulton and Watt steam engine in 1776, he was given an exclusive contract for providing cylinders.[21][56] After Watt developed a rotary steam engine in 1782, they were widely applied to blowing, hammering, rolling and slitting.[36]:124
