As of 2018, the University of Chicago Economics department, considered one of the world's foremost economics departments, has been awarded 13 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences—more than any other university—and has been awarded 6 John Bates Clark Medals.[3][4][5] However, it is important to note that not all members of the department belong to the Chicago school of economics, which is a school of thought rather than an organization.
