Wage labor has long been compared to slavery.[206][207][208][209] As a result, the phrase "wage slavery" is often utilized as a pejorative for wage labor.[210] Similarly, advocates of slavery looked upon the "comparative evils of Slave Society and of Free Society, of slavery to human Masters and slavery to Capital"[211] and proceeded to argue that wage slavery was actually worse than chattel slavery.[212] Slavery apologists like George Fitzhugh contended that workers only accepted wage labor with the passage of time as they became "familiarised and inattentive to the infected social atmosphere they continually inhale".[211] Scholars have debated the exact relationship between wage labor, slavery, and capitalism at length, especially for the Antebellum South.[213]
