In 1778, Smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in Scotland and went to live with his mother (who died in 1784)[47] in Panmure House in Edinburgh's Canongate.[48] Five years later, as a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh when it received its royal charter, he automatically became one of the founding members of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.[49] From 1787 to 1789, he occupied the honorary position of Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow.[50]
