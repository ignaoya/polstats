Keynes and Hayek debated the former's theory of money. Keynes felt that Hayek was splitting hairs with him terminologically and  published a public response to the Austrian's criticisms, writing, “Dr Hayek has seriously misapprehended the character of my conclusions. He thinks that my central contention is something different from what it really is”; “It is essential to that theory to deny these propositions which Dr Hayek puts in my mouth.”  The meat of their disagreement from Keynes's perspective concerned ancillary points, and semantic differences in definition, leading him to conclude that Hayek was nit-picking: “So long as a problem of this major magnitude is not cleared up between us, what is the use of discussing 'irritating' terminology, which might not bother Dr Hayek at all if he were not, for these excellent other reasons, looking for trouble? Dr Hayek has missed, or at least does not discuss, the critical point at which our arguments part company. Having passed this by, but finding himself being led down strange and distasteful paths, he tries to prevent himself from being dragged along any further by representing the molehills in the pathway as mountains”
