While intellectual property may be important, Baker (2016) cites multiple sources claiming that "stronger patent protection seems to be associated with slower growth".  That's particularly true for patents in the ethical health care industry.  In effect taxpayers pay twice for new drugs and diagnostic procedures:  First in tax subsidies and second for the high prices of diagnostic procedures treatments.  If the results of research paid by taxpayers were placed in the public domain, Baker claims that people everywhere would be healthier, because better diagnoses and treatment would be more affordable the world over.[95]
