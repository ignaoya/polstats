In capitalist theoretics, the profit motive is said to ensure that resources are being allocated efficiently. For instance, Austrian economist Henry Hazlitt explains: "If there is no profit in making an article, it is a sign that the labor and capital devoted to its production are misdirected: the value of the resources that must be used up in making the article is greater than the value of the article itself".[94] In other words, profits let companies know whether an item is worth producing. Theoretically[according to whom?], in free and competitive markets maximising profit ensures that resources are not wasted.
