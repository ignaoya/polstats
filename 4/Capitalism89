Rudolf Hilferding is credited[by whom?] with first bringing the term finance capitalism into prominence through Finance Capital, his 1910 study of the links between German trusts, banks and monopoliesâ€”a study subsumed by Vladimir Lenin into Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (1917), his analysis of the imperialist relations of the great world powers.[123] Lenin concluded that the banks at that time operated as "the chief nerve centres of the whole capitalist system of national economy".[124] For the Comintern (founded in 1919), the phrase "dictatorship of finance capitalism"[125] became a regular one.
