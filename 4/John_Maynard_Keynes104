Keynes's friends in the Bloomsbury Group were initially surprised when, in his later years, he began pursuing affairs with women,[150] demonstrating himself to be bisexual.[151] Ray Costelloe (who later married Oliver Strachey) was an early heterosexual interest of Keynes.[152] In 1906, Keynes had written of this infatuation that, "I seem to have fallen in love with Ray a little bit, but as she isn't male I haven't [been] able to think of any suitable steps to take."[153]
