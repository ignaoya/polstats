While Friedman often mentioned Hayek as an important influence, Hayek rarely mentioned Friedman.[178]  He deeply disagreed with Chicago School methodology, quantitative and macroeconomic focus, and claimed that Friedman's Essays in Positive Economics was as dangerous book as Keynes' General Theory.[179]  Friedman also claimed that despite some Popperian influence Hayek always retained basic Misesian praxeological view which he found "utterly nonsensical".[180]  He also noted that he admired Hayek only for his political works, and disagreed with his technical economics; he called Prices and Production a "very flawed book" and The Pure Theory of Capital "unreadable". [181]  There were occasional tensions at the Mont Pelerin meetings between the Hayek's and Friedman's followers that sometimes threatened to split the Society.[65]  Although they worked at the same university and shared political beliefs, Hayek and Friedman rarely collaborated professionally and were not close friends.[66]
