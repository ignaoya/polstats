In the Treatise Keynes drew a distinction between savings and investment, arguing that where saving exceeded investment, recession would occur. Thus, Keynes reasoned that during a depression the best course of action would be to promote spending and to discourage saving.[1] Keynes most notably clarified his Theory of Money in catty dialog[2] with other famous economists of the day, such as Friedrich Hayek and Dennis Robertson.  Keynes described his rejoinder as such “in my Rejoinder to Mr. D. H. Robertson, Published in the Economic Journal for September, 1931, I have endeavored to re-state in a clearer way what my own theory actually is.”[3]
