Like several other notable British authors of his time, Keynes was a member of the Bloomsbury Group. Virginia Woolf's biographer tells an anecdote of how Virginia Woolf, Keynes, and T. S. Eliot discussed religion at a dinner party, in the context of their struggle against Victorian era morality.[164]
Keynes may have been confirmed,[165] but according to Cambridge University he was clearly an agnostic, which he remained until his death.[166] According to one biographer, "he was never able to take religion seriously, regarding it as a strange aberration of the human mind."[165]
