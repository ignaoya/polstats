In line with Hayek, an increasing number of contemporary researchers sees expansionary monetary policies and too low interest rates as mal-incentives and main drivers of financial crises in general and the subprime market crisis in particular.[202][203] To prevent problems caused by monetary policy, Hayekian and Austrian economists discuss alternatives to current policies and organizations. For instance, Lawrence H. White has argued in favor of free banking in the spirit of Hayek's "Denationalization of Money".[204] Along with market monetarist economist Scott Sumner,[205] White has also noted that the monetary policy norm that Hayek prescribed, first in Prices and Production (1931) and as late as the 1970s,[206][207] was the stabilization of nominal income.[208]
