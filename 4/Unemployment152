The 2008â€“2012 global recession has been called a "mancession" because of the disproportionate number of men who lost their jobs as compared to women. The gender gap became wide in the United States in 2009, when 10.5% of men in the labor force were unemployed, compared with 8% of women.[162][163] Three quarters of the jobs that were lost in the recession in the US were held by men.[164][165]
