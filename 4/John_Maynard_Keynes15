By 1909 Keynes had published his first professional economics article in The Economic Journal, about the effect of a recent global economic downturn on India.[24] He founded the Political Economy Club, a weekly discussion group. Also in 1909, Keynes accepted a lectureship in economics funded personally by Alfred Marshall. Keynes's earnings rose further as he began to take on pupils for private tuition.
