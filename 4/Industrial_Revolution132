According to Robert Hughes in The Fatal Shore, the population of England and Wales, which had remained steady at six million from 1700 to 1740, rose dramatically after 1740. The population of England had more than doubled from 8.3 million in 1801 to 16.8 million in 1850 and, by 1901, had nearly doubled again to 30.5 million.[134] Improved conditions led to the population of Britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 1800s.[135][136] Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.[137]
