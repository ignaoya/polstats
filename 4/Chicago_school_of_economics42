While the efficacy of Eugene Fama's efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) was debated after the financial crisis of 2007â€“08, proponents emphasized that the EMH is consistent with the large decline in asset prices since the event was unpredictable.[71] Specifically, if market crashes never occurred, this would contradict the EMH since the average return of risky assets would be too large to justify the decreased risk of a large decline in prices; and if anything, the equity premium puzzle implies that market crashes do not happen enough to justify the high Sharpe ratio of US stocks and other risky assets.
