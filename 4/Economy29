An informal economy is the set of economic activities operating as to partially avoid being taxed or regulated, in contrast to a formal economy. The informal economy is thus not included in that government's gross national product (GNP). Although the informal economy is often associated with developing countries, all economic systems contain an informal economy in some proportion.
