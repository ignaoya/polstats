Keynes once remarked that "the youth had no religion save communism and this was worse than nothing."[164] Marxism "was founded upon nothing better than a misunderstanding of Ricardo", and, given time, he (Keynes) "would deal thoroughly with the Marxists" and other economists to solve the economic problems their theories "threaten to cause".[164]
