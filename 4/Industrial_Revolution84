Joseph Foljambe's Rotherham plough of 1730 was the first commercially successful iron plough.[80][81][82][83] The threshing machine, invented by the Scottish engineer Andrew Meikle in 1784, displaced hand threshing with a flail, a laborious job that took about one-quarter of agricultural labour.[84]:286  It took several decades to diffuse[85] and was the final straw for many farm labourers, who faced near starvation, leading to the 1830 agricultural rebellion of the Swing Riots.
