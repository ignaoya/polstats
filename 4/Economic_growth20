During the Second Industrial Revolution, a major factor of productivity growth was the substitution of inanimate power for human and animal labor. Also there was a great increase in power as steam-powered electricity generation and internal combustion supplanted limited wind and water power.[23] Since that replacement, the great expansion of total power was driven by continuous improvements in energy conversion efficiency.[25] Other major historical sources of productivity were automation, transportation infrastructures (canals, railroads, and highways),[26][27] new materials (steel) and power, which includes steam and internal combustion engines and electricity. Other productivity improvements included mechanized agriculture and scientific agriculture including chemical fertilizers and livestock and poultry management, and the Green Revolution. Interchangeable parts made with machine tools powered by electric motors evolved into mass production, which is universally used today.[24]
