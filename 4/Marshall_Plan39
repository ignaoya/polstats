In late September, the Soviet Union called a meeting of nine European Communist parties in southwest Poland.[59] A Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) report was read at the outset to set the heavily anti-Western tone, stating now that "international politics is dominated by the ruling clique of the American imperialists" which have embarked upon the "enslavement of the weakened capitalist countries of Europe".[60] Communist parties were to struggle against the US presence in Europe by any means necessary, including sabotage.[61] The report further claimed that "reactionary imperialist elements throughout the world, particularly in the United States, in Britain and France, had put particular hope on Germany and Japan, primarily on Hitlerite Germanyâ€”first as a force most capable of striking a blow at the Soviet Union".[62]
