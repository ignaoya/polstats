Attitudes in the Bloomsbury Group, in which Keynes was avidly involved, were relaxed about homosexuality. Keynes, together with writer Lytton Strachey, had reshaped the Victorian attitudes of the Cambridge Apostles: "since [their] time, homosexual relations among the members were for a time common", wrote Bertrand Russell.[145]  The artist Duncan Grant, whom he met in 1908, was one of Keynes's great loves. Keynes was also involved with Lytton Strachey,[140] though they were for the most part love rivals, not lovers. Keynes had won the affections of Arthur Hobhouse,[146] and as with Grant, fell out with a jealous Strachey for it.[147] Strachey had previously found himself put off by Keynes, not least because of his manner of "treat[ing] his love affairs statistically".[148]
