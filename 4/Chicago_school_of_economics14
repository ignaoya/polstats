Henry Calvert Simons (1899–1946) did his graduate work at the University of Chicago but did not submit his final dissertation to receive a degree.[30] In fact, he was initially influenced by Frank Knight while he was an assistant professor at the University of Iowa from 1925–1927, and in summer 1927 Simons decided to join the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago (earlier than Knight did).[29][30] He was a long-term member in the Chicago economics department, most notable for his antitrust and monetarist models.[31]
