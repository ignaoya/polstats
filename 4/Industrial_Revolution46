Europe relied on the bloomery for most of its wrought iron until the large scale production of cast iron.  Conversion of cast iron was done in a finery forge, as it long had been.  An improved refining process known as potting and stamping was developed, but this was superseded by Henry Cort's puddling process. Cort developed two significant iron manufacturing processes: rolling in 1783 and puddling in 1784.[1]:91  Puddling produced a structural grade iron at a relatively low cost.
