Hayek's analysis was based on Eugen BÃ¶hm von Bawerk's concept of the "average period of production"[99] and on the effects that monetary policy could have upon it. In accordance with the reasoning later outlined in his essay "The Use of Knowledge in Society" (1945), Hayek argued that a monopolistic governmental agency like a central bank can neither possess the relevant information which should govern supply of money, nor have the ability to use it correctly.[100]
