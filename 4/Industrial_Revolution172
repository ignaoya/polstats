Technological change accelerated industrialization and urbanization. The GNP per capita grew roughly 1.76% per year from 1870â€“1913. That level of growth compared very favorably to that of other European nations such as Britain (1%), France (1.06%), and Germany (1.51%).[187] However, in a comparison with Germany and Britain: the Austro-Hungarian economy as a whole still lagged considerably, as sustained modernization had begun much later.[188]
