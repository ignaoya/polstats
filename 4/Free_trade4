Economists are generally supportive of free trade.[9] There is a broad consensus among economists that protectionism has a negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare while free trade and the reduction of trade barriers has a positive effect on economic growth[10][11][12][13][14][15] and economic stability.[16] However, liberalization of trade can cause significant and unequally distributed losses and the economic dislocation of workers in import-competing sectors.[11]
