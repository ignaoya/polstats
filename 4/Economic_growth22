Mass production of the 1920s created overproduction, which was arguably one of several causes of the Great Depression of the 1930s.[30] Following the Great Depression, economic growth resumed, aided in part by increased demand for existing goods and services, such as automobiles, telephones, radios, electricity and household appliances. New goods and services included television, air conditioning and commercial aviation (after 1950), creating enough new demand to stabilize the work week.[31] The building of highway infrastructures also contributed to post World War II growth, as did capital investments in manufacturing and chemical industries.[32] The post World War II economy also benefited from the discovery of vast amounts of oil around the world, particularly in the Middle East. By John W. Kendrick's estimate, three-quarters of increase in U.S. per capita GDP from 1889 to 1957 was due to increased productivity.[14]
