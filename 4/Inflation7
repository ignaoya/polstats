The term "inflation" originally referred to a rise in the general price level caused by an imbalance between the quantity of money and trade needs.[16] However, economists today commonly use the term "inflation" to refer to increases in the price level. An increase in the money supply may be called monetary inflation, to distinguish it from rising prices, which for clarity may be called "price inflation".[17] Economists generally agree that in the long run, price inflation is related to increases in the money supply.[18]
