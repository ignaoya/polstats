Due to the growing importance of the financial sector in modern times,[4] the term real economy is used by analysts[5][6] as well as politicians[7] to denote the part of the economy that is concerned with the actual production of goods and services,[8] as ostensibly  contrasted with the paper economy, or the financial side of the economy,[9] which is concerned with buying and selling on the financial markets. Alternate and long-standing terminology distinguishes measures of an economy expressed in real values (adjusted for inflation), such as real GDP, or in nominal values (unadjusted for inflation).[10]
