Smith's statement about the benefits of "an invisible hand" may be meant to answer[citation needed] Mandeville's contention that "Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits".[90] It shows Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest under conditions of justice, he unintentionally promotes the good of society.
