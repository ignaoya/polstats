Hot blast, patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828, was the most important development of the 19th century for saving energy in making pig iron.  By using preheated combustion air, the amount of fuel to make a unit of pig iron was reduced at first by between one-third using coke or two-thirds using coal;[61] however, the efficiency gains continued as the technology improved.[62] Hot blast also raised the operating temperature of furnaces, increasing their capacity.  Using less coal or coke meant introducing fewer impurities into the pig iron.  This meant that lower quality coal or anthracite could be used in areas where coking coal was unavailable or too expensive;[63] however, by the end of the 19th century transportation costs fell considerably.
