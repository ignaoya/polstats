In Why Nations Fail, Acemoglu and Robinson said that the English in North America started by trying to repeat the success of the Spanish Conquistadors in extracting wealth (especially gold and silver) from the countries they had conquered.  This system repeatedly failed for the English .  Their successes rested on giving land and a voice in the government to every male settler to incentivize productive labor.  In Virginia it took twelve years and many deaths from starvation before the governor decided to try democracy.[74]
