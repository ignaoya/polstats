Friedman was an advisor to Republican President Ronald Reagan[3] and Conservative British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.[2] His political philosophy extolled the virtues of a free market economic system with minimal government intervention. He once stated that his role in eliminating conscription in the United States was his proudest accomplishment. In his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom, Friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military, freely floating exchange rates, abolition of medical licenses, a negative income tax and school vouchers[14] and opposed the war on drugs. His support for school choice led him to found the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, later renamed EdChoice.[15]
