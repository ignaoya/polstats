The notion that bilateral trade deficits are bad in and of themselves is overwhelmingly rejected by trade experts and economists.[2][3][4][5][6] According to the IMF trade deficits can cause a balance of payments problem, which can affect foreign exchange shortages and hurt countries.[29] On the other hand, Joseph Stiglitz points out that countries running surpluses exert a "negative externality" on trading partners, and pose a threat to global prosperity, far more than those in deficit.[30][31][32] Ben Bernanke argues that "persistent imbalances within the euro zone are... unhealthy, as they lead to financial imbalances as well as to unbalanced growth. The fact that Germany is selling so much more than it is buying redirects demand from its neighbors (as well as from other countries around the world), reducing output and employment outside Germany."[33]
