In Keynes’ Treatise, he does not agree that booms and busts happen solely because of extrinsic random variables such as “sunspots”. Instead, he believes that economic events emerge when there are discrepancies between savings and investments.
According to Keynes, a true measure of a nation's prosperity is not anything of physical value such as gold or silver, but by national income. To him, the most important characteristic of national income is consumption.[4]
