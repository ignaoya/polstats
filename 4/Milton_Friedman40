The proposal to constantly grow the money supply at a certain predetermined amount every year has become known as Friedman's k-percent rule.[84] There is debate about the effectiveness of a theoretical money supply targeting regime.[85][86] The Fed's inability to meet its money supply targets from 1978â€“1982 has led some to conclude it is not a feasible alternative to more conventional inflation and interest rate targeting.[87] Towards the end of his life, Friedman expressed doubt about the validity of targeting the quantity of money.[88]
