In terms of social structure, the Industrial Revolution witnessed the triumph of a middle class of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry. Ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories, but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines. As late as the year 1900, most industrial workers in the United States still worked a 10-hour day (12 hours in the steel industry), yet earned from 20% to 40% less than the minimum deemed necessary for a decent life;[147] however, most workers in textiles, which was by far the leading industry in terms of employment, were women and children.[40] For workers of the labouring classes, industrial life "was a stony desert, which they had to make habitable by their own efforts."[148] Also, harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the Industrial Revolution took place. Pre-industrial society was very static and often cruel â€“ child labour, dirty living conditions, and long working hours were just as prevalent before the Industrial Revolution.[149]
