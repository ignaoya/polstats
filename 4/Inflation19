From the second half of the 15th century to the first half of the 17th, Western Europe experienced a major inflationary cycle referred to as the "price revolution",[32][33] with prices on average rising perhaps sixfold over 150 years. This was largely caused by the sudden influx of gold and silver from the New World into Habsburg Spain.[34] The silver spread throughout a previously cash-starved Europe and caused widespread inflation.[35][36] Demographic factors also contributed to upward pressure on prices, with European population growth after depopulation caused by the Black Death pandemic.
