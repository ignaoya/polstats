In 1871, a group of Japanese politicians known as the Iwakura Mission toured Europe and the United States to learn western ways. The result was a deliberate state-led industrialisation policy to enable Japan to quickly catch up. The Bank of Japan, founded in 1882,[191] used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories. Education was expanded and Japanese students were sent to study in the west.
