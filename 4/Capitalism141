Critics of capitalism associate the economic system with social and economic inequality; unfair distribution of wealth and power; materialism; repression of workers and trade unionists; social alienation; unemployment; and economic instability. Many socialists consider capitalism to be irrational in that production and the direction of the economy are unplanned, creating many inconsistencies and internal contradictions.[156] Capitalism and individual property rights have been associated with the tragedy of the anticommons where owners are unable to agree. Marxian economist Richard D. Wolff postulates that: capitalist economies prioritize profits and capital accumulation over the social needs of communities; and that capitalist enterprises rarely include the workers in the basic decisions of the enterprise.[157]
