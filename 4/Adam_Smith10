Smith considered the teaching at Glasgow to be far superior to that at Oxford, which he found intellectually stifling.[19] In Book V, Chapter II of The Wealth of Nations, he wrote: "In the University of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching."
Smith is also reported to have complained to friends that Oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of David Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature, and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it.[15][20][21] According to William Robert Scott, "The Oxford of [Smith's] time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework."[22] Nevertheless, he took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large Bodleian Library.[23] When Smith was not studying on his own, his time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to his letters.[24] Near the end of his time there, he began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown.[25] He left Oxford University in 1746, before his scholarship ended.[25][26]
