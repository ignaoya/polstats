Although few events in Smith's early childhood are known, the Scottish journalist John Rae, Smith's biographer, recorded that Smith was abducted by Romani at the age of three and released when others went to rescue him.[b][16] Smith was close to his mother, who probably encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions.[17] He attended the Burgh School of Kirkcaldy—characterised by Rae as "one of the best secondary schools of Scotland at that period"[15]—from 1729 to 1737, he learned Latin, mathematics, history, and writing.[17]
