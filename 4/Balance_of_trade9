The monetary balance of trade is different from the physical balance of trade[10] (which is expressed in amount of raw materials, known also as Total Material Consumption). Developed countries usually import a substantial amount of raw materials from developing countries. Typically, these imported materials are transformed into finished products and might be exported after adding value. Financial trade balance statistics conceal material flow. Most developed countries have a large physical trade deficit because they consume more raw materials than they produce. Many[who?] civil society organisations claim this imbalance is predatory and campaign for ecological debt repayment.
