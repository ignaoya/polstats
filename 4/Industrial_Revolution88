At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads, with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea. Wagonways were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment, but canals had not yet been widely constructed. Animals supplied all of the motive power on land, with sails providing the motive power on the sea.  The first horse railways were introduced toward the end of the 18th century, with steam locomotives being introduced in the early decades of the 19th century.  Improving sailing technologies boosted average sailing speed 50% between 1750 and 1830.[87]
