Samuel Crompton's Spinning Mule was introduced in 1779.  Mule implies a hybrid because it was a combination of the spinning jenny and the water frame, in which the spindles were placed on a carriage, which went through an operational sequence during which the rollers stopped while the carriage moved away from the drawing roller to finish drawing out the fibres as the spindles started rotating.[43]:832  Crompton's mule was able to produce finer thread than hand spinning and at a lower cost.  Mule spun thread was of suitable strength to be used as warp, and finally allowed Britain to produce highly competitive yarn in large quantities.[43]:832
