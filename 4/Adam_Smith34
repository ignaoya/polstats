Smith was also a close friend of David Hume, who was commonly characterised in his own time as an atheist.[72] The publication in 1777 of Smith's letter to William Strahan, in which he described Hume's courage in the face of death in spite of his irreligiosity, attracted considerable controversy.[73]
