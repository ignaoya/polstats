In 1917, Hayek joined an artillery regiment in the Austro-Hungarian Army and fought on the Italian front. Much of Hayek's combat experience was spent as a spotter in an aeroplane. Hayek suffered damage to his hearing in his left ear during the war[34] and was decorated for bravery. During this time, Hayek also survived the 1918 flu pandemic.[35]
