Coke pig iron was hardly used to produce wrought iron until 1755–56, when Darby's son Abraham Darby II built furnaces at Horsehay and Ketley where low sulfur coal was available (and not far from Coalbrookdale).  These new furnaces were equipped with water-powered bellows, the water being pumped by Newcomen steam engines.  The Newcomen engines were not attached directly to the blowing cylinders because the engines alone could not produce a steady air blast.  Abraham Darby III installed similar steam-pumped, water-powered blowing cylinders at the Dale Company when he took control in 1768.  The Dale Company used several Newcomen engines to drain its mines and made parts for engines which it sold throughout the country.[36]:123–25
