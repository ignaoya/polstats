The spinning frame or water frame was developed by Richard Arkwright who, along with two partners, patented it in 1769. The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas High by clockmaker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright.[43]:827â€“30  For each spindle the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed, to draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle.  The roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length.  Too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread.  The top rollers were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight.  The weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. The bottom rollers were wood and metal, with fluting along the length.  The water frame was able to produce a hard, medium count thread suitable for warp, finally allowing 100% cotton cloth to be made in Britain.  A horse powered the first factory to use the spinning frame. Arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in Cromford, Derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its name.
