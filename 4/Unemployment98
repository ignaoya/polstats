Costs of unemployment also vary depending on age. The young and the old are the two largest age groups currently experiencing unemployment.[99] A 2007 study from Jacob and Kleinert found that young people (ages 18 to 24) who have fewer resources and limited work experiences are more likely to be unemployed.[100] Other researchers have found that today's high school seniors place a lower value on work than those in the past, which is likely because they recognize the limited availability of jobs.[101] At the other end of the age spectrum, studies have found that older individuals have more barriers than younger workers to employment, require stronger social networks to acquire work, and are also less likely to move from temporary to permanent positions.[94][99] Additionally, some older people see age discrimination as the reason for them not getting hired.[102]
