The novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand made positive moral defenses of laissez-faire capitalism, most notably in her 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged and in her 1966 collection of essays Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal. She argued that capitalism should be supported on moral grounds, not just on the basis of practical benefits.[264][265] Her ideas have had significant influence over conservative and libertarian supporters of capitalism, especially within the American Tea Party movement.[266] Rand defined capitalism as "a social system based on the recognition of individual rights, including property rights, in which all property is privately owned".[267] According to Rand, the role of government in a capitalist state has three broad categories of proper functions: first, the police "to protect men from criminals"; second, the armed services "to protect men from foreign invaders"; and third, the law courts "to settle disputes among men according to objective laws".[268]
