In his 1870 essay "On the Graphical Representation of Supply and Demand", Fleeming Jenkin in the course of "introduc[ing] the diagrammatic method into the English economic literature" published the first drawing of supply and demand curves therein,[111] including comparative statics from a shift of supply or demand and application to the labor market.[112] The model was further developed and popularized by Alfred Marshall in the 1890 textbook Principles of Economics.[110]
