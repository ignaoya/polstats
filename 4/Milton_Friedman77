Political scientist C.B. Macpherson disagreed with Friedman's historical assessment of economic freedom leading to political freedom, suggesting that political freedom actually gave way to economic freedom for property-owning elites. He also challenged the notion that markets efficiently allocated resources and rejected Friedman's definition of liberty.[164] Friedman's positivist methodological approach to economics has also been critiqued and debated.[165][166][167] Finnish economist Uskali MÃ¤ki has argued some of his assumptions were unrealistic and vague.[168][169]
