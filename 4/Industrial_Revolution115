The effects on living conditions of the industrial revolution have been very controversial, and were hotly debated by economic and social historians from the 1950s to the 1980s.[110] A series of 1950s essays by Henry Phelps Brown and Sheila V. Hopkins later set the academic consensus that the bulk of the population, that was at the bottom of the social ladder, suffered severe reductions in their living standards.[110] During 1813â€“1913, there was a significant increase in worker wages.[111][112]
