Smith began delivering public lectures in 1748 at the University of Edinburgh,[28] sponsored by the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh under the patronage of Lord Kames.[29] His lecture topics included rhetoric and belles-lettres,[30] and later the subject of "the progress of opulence". On this latter topic, he first expounded his economic philosophy of "the obvious and simple system of natural liberty". While Smith was not adept at public speaking, his lectures met with success.[31]
