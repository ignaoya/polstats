Now to your question: 'Do those almost with us do more harm than 100% enemies?’ I don’t think this can be answered with a flat 'yes' or 'no,’ because the 'almost' is such a wide term. There is one general rule to observe: those who are with us, but merely do not go far enough are the ones who may do us some good. Those who agree with us in some respects, yet preach contradictory ideas at the same time, are definitely more harmful than 100% enemies. As an example of the kind of 'almost' I would tolerate, I’d name Ludwig von Mises. As an example of our most pernicious enemy, I would name Hayek. That one is real poison.[184]
