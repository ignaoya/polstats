 Full employment cannot be achieved because workers would shirk if they were not threatened with the possibility of unemployment.[111] The curve for the no-shirking condition (labelled NSC) thus goes to infinity at full employment. The inflation-fighting benefits to the entire economy arising from a presumed optimum level of unemployment have been studied extensively.[112] The Shapiroâ€“Stiglitz model suggests that wages never bid down sufficiently to reach 0% unemployment.[113] That occurs because employers know that when wages decrease, workers will shirk and expend less effort. Employers avoid shirking by preventing wages from decreasing so low that workers give up and become unproductive. The higher wages perpetuate unemployment, but the threat of unemployment reduces shirking.
