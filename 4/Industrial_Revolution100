"A good horse on an ordinary turnpike road can draw two thousand pounds, or one ton.  A party of gentlemen were invited to witness the experiment, that the superiority of the new road might be established by ocular demonstration.  Twelve wagons were loaded with stones, till each wagon weighed three tons, and the wagons were fastened together.  A horse was then attached, which drew the wagons with ease, six miles in two hours, having stopped four times, in order to show he had the power of starting, as well as drawing his great load."[98]
