In 1940, Friedman accepted a position at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, but left because of differences with faculty regarding United States involvement in World War II. Friedman believed the United States should enter the war.[42] In 1943, Friedman joined the Division of War Research at Columbia University (headed by W. Allen Wallis and Harold Hotelling), where he spent the rest of World War II working as a mathematical statistician, focusing on problems of weapons design, military tactics, and metallurgical experiments.[42][43]
