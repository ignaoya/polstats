Friedman's challenges to what he later called "naive Keynesian theory"[7] began with his 1950s interpretation of the consumption function. During the 1960s he became the main advocate opposing Keynesian government policies,[8] and described his approach (along with mainstream economics) as using "Keynesian language and apparatus" yet rejecting its initial conclusions.[9] He theorized that there existed a natural rate of unemployment and argued that unemployment below this rate would cause inflation to accelerate.[10] He argued that the Phillips curve was in the long run vertical at the 'natural rate' and predicted what would come to be known as stagflation.[11] Friedman promoted an alternative macroeconomic viewpoint known as 'monetarism' and argued that a steady, small expansion of the money supply was the preferred policy.[12] His ideas concerning monetary policy, taxation, privatization and deregulation influenced government policies, especially during the 1980s. His monetary theory influenced the Federal Reserve's response to the global financial crisis of 2007â€“2008.[13]
