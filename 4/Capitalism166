Aristotle made the statement that "the citizens must not live a mechanic or a mercantile life (for such a life is ignoble and inimical to virtue), nor yet must those who are to be citizens in the best state be tillers of the soil (for leisure is needed both for the development of virtue and for active participation in politics)",[230] often paraphrased as "all paid jobs absorb and degrade the mind".[231] Cicero wrote in 44 BC that "vulgar are the means of livelihood of all hired workmen whom we pay for mere manual labour, not for artistic skill; for in their case the very wage they receive is a pledge of their slavery".[232] Somewhat similar criticisms have also been expressed by some proponents of liberalism, like Henry George,[233][234] Silvio Gesell and Thomas Paine[235] as well as the Distributist school of thought within the Roman Catholic Church.
