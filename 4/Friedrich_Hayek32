His father's career as a university professor influenced Hayek's goals later in life.[22] Both of his grandfathers, who lived long enough for Hayek to know them, were scholars. Franz von Juraschek was a leading economist in Austria-Hungary and a close friend of Eugen BÃ¶hm von Bawerk, one of the founders of the Austrian School of Economics.[23] Hayek's paternal grandfather, Gustav Edler von Hayek, taught natural sciences at the Imperial Realobergymnasium (secondary school) in Vienna. He wrote works in the field of biological systematics, some of which are relatively well known.[24]
