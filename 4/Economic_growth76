Recent papers based on superior data, find negative relationship between inequality and growth. Andrew Berg and Jonathan Ostry of the International Monetary Fund, find that "lower net inequality is robustly correlated with faster and more durable growth, controlling for the level of redistribution".[116] Likewise, Dierk Herzer and Sebastian Vollmer find that increased income inequality reduces economic growth.[117]
