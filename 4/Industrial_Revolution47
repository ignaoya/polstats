Puddling was a means of decarburizing molten pig iron by slow oxidation in a reverberatory furnace by manually stirring it with a long rod.  The decarburized iron, having a higher melting point than cast iron, was raked into globs by the puddler.  When the glob was large enough, the puddler would remove it.  Puddling was backbreaking and extremely hot work.  Few puddlers lived to be 40.[59] Because puddling was done in a reverberatory furnace, coal or coke could be used as fuel.  The puddling process continued to be used until the late 19th century when iron was being displaced by steel.  Because puddling required human skill in sensing the iron globs, it was never successfully mechanised. Rolling was an important part of the puddling process because the grooved rollers expelled most of the molten slag and consolidated the mass of hot wrought iron. Rolling was 15 times faster at this than a trip hammer.  A different use of rolling, which was done at lower temperatures than that for expelling slag, was in the production of iron sheets, and later structural shapes such as beams, angles and rails.
