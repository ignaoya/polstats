The Greeks also created early manuscripts about mental disorders.[98] In the 4th century BCE, Hippocrates theorized that physiological abnormalities may be the root of mental disorders.[99] In 4th to 5th Century B.C. Greece, Hippocrates wrote that he visited Democritus and found him in his garden cutting open animals. Democritus explained that he was attempting to discover the cause of madness and melancholy. Hippocrates praised his work. Democritus had with him a book on madness and melancholy.[100] During the 5th century BCE, mental disorders, especially those with psychotic traits, were considered supernatural in origin,[99] a view which existed throughout ancient Greece and Rome,[99] as well as Egyptian regions.[101][pageÂ needed] Religious leaders often turned to versions of exorcism to treat mental disorders often utilizing methods that many consider to be cruel or barbaric methods. Trepanning was one of these methods used throughout history.[99]
