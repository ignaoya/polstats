The amount and quality of education required to be an NP has been the subject of controversy in the United States. Opponents of independent practice have argued that NP education can consist of online coursework with few hours of actual patient contact.[13] To become an NP requires between 1.5 and 3 years of post-baccalaureate training, in addition to prior training and experience as an RN, though there are alternate routes to training. A new nurse practitioner may have between 500 and 1,000 hours of clinical training.[1] The quality of education and of applicants for NP schools has been cited as a reason to not allow NPs to practice medicine autonomously. Some graduate nursing schools have 100% acceptance rates.[14]
