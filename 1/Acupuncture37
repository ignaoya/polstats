A 2014 overview of systematic reviews found insufficient evidence to suggest that acupuncture is an effective treatment for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in a clinical setting.[122] A 2013 systematic review concluded that acupuncture might be beneficial in prevention and treatment of PONV.[123] A 2015 Cochrane review found moderate-quality evidence of no difference between stimulation of the P6 acupoint on the wrist and antiemetic drugs for preventing PONV.[124] A new finding of the review was that further comparative trials are futile, based on the conclusions of a trial sequential analysis.[125] Whether combining PC6 acupoint stimulation with antiemetics is effective was inconclusive.
