Anesthesia is administered to prevent pain from an incision, tissue manipulation and suturing.  Depending on the kind of operation, anesthesia may be provided locally or as general anesthesia.  Spinal anesthesia may be used when the surgical site is too large or deep for a local block, but general anesthesia may not be desirable.  With local and spinal anesthesia, the surgical site is anesthetized, but the person can remain conscious or minimally sedated.  In contrast, general anesthesia renders the person unconscious and paralyzed during surgery.  The person is intubated and is placed on a mechanical ventilator, and anesthesia is produced by a combination of injected and inhaled agents.
Choice of surgical method and anesthetic technique aims to reduce the risk of complications, shorten the time needed for recovery and minimise the surgical stress response.
