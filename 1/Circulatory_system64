In 1956, André Frédéric Cournand, Werner Forssmann and Dickinson W. Richards were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine "for their discoveries concerning heart catheterization and pathological changes in the circulatory system."[27]
In his Nobel lecture, Forssmann credits Harvey as birthing cardiology with the publication of his book in 1628.[28]
