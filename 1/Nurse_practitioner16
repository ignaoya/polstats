In Australia, RNs who have the equivalent of three years of full-time experience (5000 hours) and have completed a program of study approved by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (a postgraduate nursing master's degree including advanced health assessment, pharmacology for prescribing, therapeutics and diagnostics and research), or a program that is substantially equivalent to an approved program of study, may apply to the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia for endorsement as a Nurse Practitioner.[27] The Australian professional organisation is the Australian College of Nurse Practitioners (ACNP).[28]
