By the end of the Song dynasty (1279Â AD), acupuncture had lost much of its status in China.[278] It became rarer in the following centuries, and was associated with less prestigious professions like alchemy, shamanism, midwifery and moxibustion.[279] Additionally, by the 18th century, scientific rationality was becoming more popular than traditional superstitious beliefs.[29] By 1757 a book documenting the history of Chinese medicine called acupuncture a "lost art".[31]:160 Its decline was attributed in part to the popularity of prescriptions and medications, as well as its association with the lower classes.[280]
