The conclusions of trials and systematic reviews of acupuncture are inconsistent, which suggests that it is not effective.[11][14][15] An overview of Cochrane reviews found that acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions.[14] A systematic review conducted by medical scientists at the universities of Exeter and Plymouth found little evidence of acupuncture's effectiveness in treating pain.[11] Overall, the evidence suggests that short-term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long-term benefits.[16] Some research results suggest that acupuncture can alleviate some forms of pain, though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture's apparent effects are not caused by the treatment itself.[8] A systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias.[17] One meta-analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was cost-effective as an adjunct to standard care,[18] while a separate systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain.[19]
