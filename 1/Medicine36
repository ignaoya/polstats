Internal medicine is the medical specialty dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of adult diseases.[44] According to some sources, an emphasis on internal structures is implied.[45] In North America, specialists in internal medicine are commonly called "internists." Elsewhere, especially in Commonwealth nations, such specialists are often called physicians.[46] These terms, internist or physician (in the narrow sense, common outside North America), generally exclude practitioners of gynecology and obstetrics, pathology, psychiatry, and especially surgery and its subspecialities.
