In 1971, a New York Times reporter published an article on his acupuncture experiences in China, which led to more investigation of and support for acupuncture.[29] The US President Richard Nixon visited China in 1972.[287] During one part of the visit, the delegation was shown a patient undergoing major surgery while fully awake, ostensibly receiving acupuncture rather than anesthesia.[287] Later it was found that the patients selected for the surgery had both a high pain tolerance and received heavy indoctrination before the operation; these demonstration cases were also frequently receiving morphine surreptitiously through an intravenous drip that observers were told contained only fluids and nutrients.[287] One patient receiving open heart surgery while awake was ultimately found to have received a combination of three powerful sedatives as well as large injections of a local anesthetic into the wound.[15] After the National Institute of Health expressed support for acupuncture for a limited number of conditions, adoption in the US grew further.[29] In 1972 the first legal acupuncture center in the US was established in Washington DC[288] and in 1973 the American Internal Revenue Service allowed acupuncture to be deducted as a medical expense.[289]
