Acupuncture is generally safe when administered by an experienced, appropriately trained practitioner using clean-needle technique and sterile single-use needles.[21] When improperly delivered it can cause adverse effects.[20] Accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect on the part of the practitioner.[21] To reduce the risk of serious adverse events after acupuncture, acupuncturists should be trained sufficiently.[11] People with serious spinal disease, such as cancer or infection, are not good candidates for acupuncture.[2] Contraindications to acupuncture (conditions that should not be treated with acupuncture) include coagulopathy disorders (e.g. hemophilia and advanced liver disease), warfarin use, severe psychiatric disorders (e.g. psychosis), and skin infections or skin trauma (e.g. burns).[2] Further, electroacupuncture should be avoided at the spot of implanted electrical devices (such as pacemakers).[2]
