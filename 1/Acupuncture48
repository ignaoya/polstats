A 2013 systematic review found 31 cases of vascular injuries caused by acupuncture, three resulting in death.[237] Two died from pericardial tamponade and one was from an aortoduodenal fistula.[237] The same review found vascular injuries were rare, bleeding and pseudoaneurysm were most prevalent.[237] A 2011 systematic review (without restriction in time or language), aiming to summarize all reported case of cardiac tamponade after acupuncture, found 26 cases resulting in 14 deaths, with little doubt about causality in most fatal instances.[238] The same review concluded cardiac tamponade was a serious, usually fatal, though theoretically avoidable complication following acupuncture, and urged training to minimize risk.[238]
