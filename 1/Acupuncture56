When used during pregnancy, the majority of adverse events caused by acupuncture were mild and transient, with few serious adverse events.[245] The most frequent mild adverse event was needling or unspecified pain, followed by bleeding.[245] Although two deaths (one stillbirth and one neonatal death) were reported, there was a lack of acupuncture-associated maternal mortality.[245] Limiting the evidence as certain, probable or possible in the causality evaluation, the estimated incidence of adverse events following acupuncture in pregnant women was 131 per 10,000.[245]
Although acupuncture is not contraindicated in pregnant women, some specific acupuncture points are particularly sensitive to needle insertion; these spots, as well as the abdominal region, should be avoided during pregnancy.[2]
