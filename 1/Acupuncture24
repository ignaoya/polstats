Using the principles of evidence-based medicine to research acupuncture is controversial, and has produced different results.[75] Some research suggests acupuncture can alleviate pain but the majority of research suggests that acupuncture's effects are mainly due to placebo.[8] Evidence suggests that any benefits of acupuncture are short-lasting.[16] There is insufficient evidence to support use of acupuncture compared to mainstream medical treatments.[85] Acupuncture is not better than mainstream treatment in the long term.[78]
