Apart from the usual filiform needle, other needle types include three-edged needles and the Nine Ancient Needles.[50] Japanese acupuncturists use extremely thin needles that are used superficially, sometimes without penetrating the skin, and surrounded by a guide tube (a 17th-century invention adopted in China and the West). Korean acupuncture uses copper needles and has a greater focus on the hand.[39]
