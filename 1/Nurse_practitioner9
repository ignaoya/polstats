A review of studies comparing outcomes of care by NPs and by physicians in primary care, urgent care, and anesthesia conducted by the Department of Veteran Affairs found that outcomes in the assessed studies were generally comparable; however, the strength of the evidence was generally low.[15] However, it has recently been shown that NPs prescribe opioids at a rate 28 times higher than their physician counterparts in states where they practice autonomously.[16]
