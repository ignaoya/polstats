Surgery is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum). Surgeons must also manage pre-operative, post-operative, and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards. Surgery has many sub-specialties, including general surgery,[31] ophthalmic surgery,[32] cardiovascular surgery, colorectal surgery,[33] neurosurgery,[34] oral and maxillofacial surgery,[35] oncologic surgery,[36] orthopedic surgery,[37] otolaryngology,[38] plastic surgery,[39] podiatric surgery, transplant surgery, trauma surgery,[40] urology,[41] vascular surgery,[42] and pediatric surgery[43]. In some centers, anesthesiology is part of the division of surgery (for historical and logistical reasons), although it is not a surgical discipline. Other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures, such as ophthalmology and dermatology, but are not considered surgical sub-specialties per se.
