This system describes how bones are connected to other bones and muscle fibers via connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments. The bones provide stability to the body. Muscles keep bones in place and also play a role in the movement of bones. To allow motion, different bones are connected by joints.  Cartilage prevents the bone ends from rubbing directly onto each other. Muscles contract to move the bone attached at the joint.
