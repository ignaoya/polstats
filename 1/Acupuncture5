Scientific investigation has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional Chinese concepts such as qi, meridians, and acupuncture points,[c][26] and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy (qi) or meridians, which was a major part of early belief systems.[7][27][28] Acupuncture is believed to have originated around 100Â BC in China, around the time The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine (Huangdi Neijing) was published,[29] though some experts suggest it could have been practiced earlier.[8] Over time, conflicting claims and belief systems emerged about the effect of lunar, celestial and earthly cycles, yin and yang energies, and a body's "rhythm" on the effectiveness of treatment.[30] Acupuncture fluctuated in popularity in China due to changes in the country's political leadership and the preferential use of rationalism or Western medicine.[29] Acupuncture spread first to Korea in the 6th century AD, then to Japan through medical missionaries,[31] and then to Europe, beginning with France.[29] In the 20th century, as it spread to the United States and Western countries, spiritual elements of acupuncture that conflicted with Western beliefs were sometimes abandoned in favor of simply tapping needles into acupuncture points.[29][32][33]
