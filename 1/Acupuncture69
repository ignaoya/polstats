The 5,000-year-old mummified body of Ötzi the Iceman was found with 15 groups of tattoos,[273] many of which were located at points on the body where acupuncture needles are used for abdominal or lower back problems. Evidence from the body suggests Otzi suffered from these conditions.[32] This has been cited as evidence that practices similar to acupuncture may have been practised elsewhere in Eurasia during the early Bronze Age;[273] however, The Oxford Handbook of the History of Medicine calls this theory "speculative".[33] It is considered unlikely that acupuncture was practised before 2000 BC.[272] The Ötzi the Iceman's tattoo marks suggest to some experts that an acupuncture-like treatment was previously used in Europe 5 millennia ago.[8]
