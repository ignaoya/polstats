Korea is believed to be the first country in Asia that acupuncture spread to outside of China.[31] Within Korea there is a legend that acupuncture was developed by emperor Dangun, though it is more likely to have been brought into Korea from a Chinese colonial prefecture in 514 AD.[31]:262–63 Acupuncture use was commonplace in Korea by the 6th century. It spread to Vietnam in the 8th and 9th centuries.[32] As Vietnam began trading with Japan and China around the 9th century, it was influenced by their acupuncture practices as well.[29] China and Korea sent "medical missionaries" that spread traditional Chinese medicine to Japan, starting around 219 AD. In 553, several Korean and Chinese citizens were appointed to re-organize medical education in Japan and they incorporated acupuncture as part of that system.[31]:264 Japan later sent students back to China and established acupuncture as one of five divisions of the Chinese State Medical Administration System.[31]:264–65
