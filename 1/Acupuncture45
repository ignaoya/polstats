A 2011 systematic review of systematic reviews (internationally and without language restrictions) found that serious complications following acupuncture continue to be reported.[11] Between 2000 and 2009, ninety-five cases of serious adverse events, including five deaths, were reported.[11] Many such events are not inherent to acupuncture but are due to malpractice of acupuncturists.[11] This might be why such complications have not been reported in surveys of adequately trained acupuncturists.[11] Most such reports originate from Asia, which may reflect the large number of treatments performed there or a relatively higher number of poorly trained Asian acupuncturists.[11] Many serious adverse events were reported from developed countries.[11] These included Australia, Austria, Canada, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US.[11] The number of adverse effects reported from the UK appears particularly unusual, which may indicate less under-reporting in the UK than other countries.[11] Reports included 38 cases of infections and 42 cases of organ trauma.[11] The most frequent adverse events included pneumothorax, and bacterial and viral infections.[11]
