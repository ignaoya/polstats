Acupuncture is most heavily practiced in China[240] and is popular in[240] the US,[20] Australia,[293] and Europe.[294] In Switzerland, acupuncture has become the most frequently used alternative medicine since 2004.[295] In the United Kingdom, a total of 4 million acupuncture treatments were administered in 2009.[296] Acupuncture is used in most pain clinics and hospices in the UK.[42] An estimated 1 in 10 adults in Australia used acupuncture in 2004.[293] In Japan, it is estimated that 25 percent of the population will try acupuncture at some point,[297] though in most cases it is not covered by public health insurance.[297] Users of acupuncture in Japan are more likely to be elderly and to have a limited education.[297] Approximately half of users surveyed indicated a likelihood to seek such remedies in the future, while 37% did not.[297] Less than one percent of the US population reported having used acupuncture in the early 1990s.[298] By the early 2010s, more than 14 million Americans reported having used acupuncture as part of their health care.[298]
