The West eventually created a belief system based on Travell trigger points that were believed to inhibit pain. They were in the same locations as China's spiritually identified acupuncture points, but under a different nomenclature.[29] The first elaborate Western treatise on acupuncture was published in 1683 by Willem ten Rhijne.[283]
