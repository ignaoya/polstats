Surgeons and public health advocates, such as Kelly McQueen, have described surgery as "Integral to the right to health".[41] This is reflected in the establishment of the WHO Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care in 2005,[42] the 2013 formation of the Lancet Commission for Global Surgery,[43] the 2015 World Bank Publication of Volume 1 of its Disease Control Priorities "Essential Surgery",[44] and the 2015 World Health Assembly 68.15 passing of the Resolution for Strengthening Emergency and Essential Surgical Care and Anesthesia as a Component of Universal Health Coverage.[45] The Lancet Commission for Global Surgery outlined the need for access to "available, affordable, timely and safe" surgical and anesthesia care;[46] dimensions paralleled in ICESCR General Comment No. 14, which similarly outlines need for available, accessible, affordable and timely healthcare.[37]
