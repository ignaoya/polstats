Several different and sometimes conflicting belief systems emerged regarding acupuncture. This may have been the result of competing schools of thought.[29] Some ancient texts referred to using acupuncture to cause bleeding, while others mixed the ideas of blood-letting and spiritual ch'i energy. Over time, the focus shifted from blood to the concept of puncturing specific points on the body, and eventually to balancing Yin and Yang energies as well.[30] According to David Ramey, no single "method or theory" was ever predominantly adopted as the standard.[276] At the time, scientific knowledge of medicine was not yet developed, especially because in China dissection of the deceased was forbidden, preventing the development of basic anatomical knowledge.[29]
