Novartis fought a protracted battle with the government of India over the patenting of its drug, Gleevec, in India, which ended up in India's Supreme Court in a case known as Novartis v. Union of India & Others.  The Supreme Court ruled narrowly against Novartis, but opponents of patenting drugs claimed it as a major victory.[48]
