Controversy has surrounded psychiatry, with scholars producing critiques. It has been argued that psychiatry: is too influenced by ideas from medicine, causing it to misunderstand the nature of mental distress; that its use of drugs is in part due to lobbying by drug companies resulting in distortion of research; that the concept of "mental illness" is often used to label and control those with beliefs and behaviours that the majority of people disagree with; and that it confuses disorders of the mind with disorders of the brain that can be treated with drugs.[128] Critique of psychiatry from within the field comes from the critical psychiatry group in the UK.
