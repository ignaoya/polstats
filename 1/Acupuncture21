It is difficult but not impossible to design rigorous research trials for acupuncture.[73][74] Due to acupuncture's invasive nature, one of the major challenges in efficacy research is in the design of an appropriate placebo control group.[75][76] For efficacy studies to determine whether acupuncture has specific effects, "sham" forms of acupuncture where the patient, practitioner, and analyst are blinded seem the most acceptable approach.[73] Sham acupuncture uses non-penetrating needles or needling at non-acupuncture points,[77] e.g. inserting needles on meridians not related to the specific condition being studied, or in places not associated with meridians.[78] The under-performance of acupuncture in such trials may indicate that therapeutic effects are due entirely to non-specific effects, or that the sham treatments are not inert, or that systematic protocols yield less than optimal treatment.[79][80]
