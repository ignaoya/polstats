Remains from the early Harappan periods of the Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300 BC) show evidence of teeth having been drilled dating back 9,000 years.[51] Susruta[52] was an ancient Indian surgeon commonly credited as the author of the treatise Sushruta Samhita. He is well known  as the "father of surgery", and his period is usually placed around 1200â€“600 BC.[53] One of the earliest known mentions of the name is from the Bower Manuscript, in which Sushruta is listed as one of the ten sages residing in the Himalayas.[54] Texts suggest that he learned surgery at Kasi from Lord Dhanvantari, the god of medicine in Hindu mythology.[55] It is one of the oldest known surgical texts and it describes in detail the examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of numerous ailments, as well as procedures for various forms of cosmetic surgery, plastic surgery and rhinoplasty.[56]
