The term "anti-psychiatry" was coined by psychiatrist David Cooper in 1967 and was later made popular by Thomas Szasz. The word "Antipsychiatrie" was already used in Germany in 1904.[129] The basic premise of the anti-psychiatry movement is that psychiatrists attempt to classify "normal" people as "deviant;" psychiatric treatments are ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients; and psychiatry's history involves (what may now be seen as) dangerous treatments, such as the frontal lobectomy (commonly called a lobotomy).[130] Several former patient groups have been formed often referring to themselves as "survivors."[131] In 1973, the Rosenhan experiment was conducted to determine the validity of psychiatric diagnosis. Volunteers feigned hallucinations to enter psychiatric hospitals, and acted normally afterwards. They were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders and were given antipsychotic drugs. The study was conducted by psychologist David Rosenhan, a Stanford University professor, and published by the journal Science under the title "On being sane in insane places".[132] However, the neutrality of the project is nowadays often questioned and the project itself is seen by many experts as manipulated.[133][134]
