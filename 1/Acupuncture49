A 2012 review found a number of adverse events were reported after acupuncture in the UK's National Health Service (NHS) but most (95%) were not severe,[43] though miscategorization and under-reporting may alter the total figures.[43] From January 2009 to December 2011, 468 safety incidents were recognized within the NHS organizations.[43] The adverse events recorded included retained needles (31%), dizziness (30%), loss of consciousness/unresponsive (19%), falls (4%), bruising or soreness at needle site (2%), pneumothorax (1%) and other adverse side effects (12%).[43] Acupuncture practitioners should know, and be prepared to be responsible for, any substantial harm from treatments.[43] Some acupuncture proponents argue that the long history of acupuncture suggests it is safe.[43] However, there is an increasing literature on adverse events (e.g. spinal-cord injury).[43]
