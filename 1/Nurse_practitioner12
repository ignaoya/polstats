NPs can legally examine patients, diagnose illness, prescribe some medications, and provide treatments. In 2017, twenty-two states gave full practice authority to NPs and do not require the supervision of a physician. Thirty-eight states require NPs to have a written agreement with a physician in order to provide care. Twelve of those states require NPs to be supervised or delegated by a physician, this physician may not be on site.[23]
