Acupuncture, along with moxibustion, is one of the oldest practices of traditional Chinese medicine.[31] Most historians believe the practice began in China, though there are some conflicting narratives on when it originated.[29][32] Academics David Ramey and Paul Buell said the exact date acupuncture was founded depends on the extent to which dating of ancient texts can be trusted and the interpretation of what constitutes acupuncture.[272]
