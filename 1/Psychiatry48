At the turn of the century, England and France combined had only a few hundred individuals in asylums.[116] By the late 1890s and early 1900s, this number had risen to the hundreds of thousands. However, the idea that mental illness could be ameliorated through institutionalization ran into difficulties.[117] Psychiatrists were pressured by an ever-increasing patient population,[117] and asylums again became almost indistinguishable from custodial institutions.[118]
