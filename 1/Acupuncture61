In TCM, disease is generally perceived as a disharmony or imbalance in energies such as yin, yang, qi, xuĕ, zàng-fǔ, meridians, and of the interaction between the body and the environment.[253] Therapy is based on which "pattern of disharmony" can be identified.[254][255] For example, some diseases are believed to be caused by meridians being invaded with an excess of wind, cold, and damp.[256] In order to determine which pattern is at hand, practitioners examine things like the color and shape of the tongue, the relative strength of pulse-points, the smell of the breath, the quality of breathing, or the sound of the voice.[257][258] TCM and its concept of disease does not strongly differentiate between the cause and effect of symptoms.[259]
