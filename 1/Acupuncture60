Acupuncture is a substantial part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Early acupuncture beliefs relied on concepts that are common in TCM, such as a life force energy called qi.[250] Qi was believed to flow from the body's primary organs (zang-fu organs) to the "superficial" body tissues of the skin, muscles, tendons, bones, and joints, through channels called meridians.[251] Acupuncture points where needles are inserted are mainly (but not always) found at locations along the meridians.[252] Acupuncture points not found along a meridian are called extraordinary points and those with no designated site are called "A-shi" points.[252]
