Acupuncture is the insertion of thin needles into the skin.[3] According to the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (Mayo Clinic), a typical session entails lying still while approximately five to twenty needles are inserted; for the majority of cases, the needles will be left in place for ten to twenty minutes.[35] It can be associated with the application of heat, pressure, or laser light.[3] Classically, acupuncture is individualized and based on philosophy and intuition, and not on scientific research.[36] There is also a non-invasive therapy developed in early 20th century Japan using an elaborate set of instruments other than needles for the treatment of children (shōnishin or shōnihari).[37][38]
