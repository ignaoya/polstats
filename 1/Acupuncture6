Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine.[2] It is used most commonly for pain relief,[11][12] though it is also used to treat a wide range of conditions. Acupuncture is generally only used in combination with other forms of treatment.[13] For example, the American Society of Anesthesiologists states it may be considered in the treatment for nonspecific, noninflammatory low back pain only in conjunction with conventional therapy.[34]
