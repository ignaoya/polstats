A nurse practitioner (NP) is an advanced practice registered nurse and a type of mid-level practitioner. NPs are trained to assess patient needs, order and interpret diagnostic and laboratory tests, diagnose disease, formulate and prescribe treatment plans. NP training covers basic disease prevention, coordination of care, and health promotion, but does not provide the depth of expertise needed to recognize more complex conditions.[1][2] According to the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, an organization that lobbies for the expansion of the scope of practice of NPs, NPs are educated at the graduate level to provide "primary, acute, chronic, and specialty care to patients of all ages", depending on their field of practice.[3]
