A tendon is a tough, flexible band of fibrous connective tissue that connects muscles to bones.[13]  The extra-cellular connective tissue between muscle fibers binds to tendons at the distal and proximal ends, and the tendon binds to the periosteum of individual bones at the muscle's origin and insertion. As muscles contract, tendons transmit the forces to the relatively rigid bones, pulling on them and causing movement.  Tendons can stretch substantially, allowing them to function as springs during locomotion, thereby saving energy.
