Ramey and Buell said the "practice and theoretical underpinnings" of modern acupuncture were introduced in The Yellow Emperor's Classic (Huangdi Neijing) around 100Â BC.[30][272] It introduced the concept of using acupuncture to manipulate the flow of life energy (qi) in a network of meridian (channels) in the body.[272][277] The network concept was made up of acu-tracts, such as a line down the arms, where it said acupoints were located. Some of the sites acupuncturists use needles at today still have the same names as those given to them by the Yellow Emperor's Classic.[31]:93 Numerous additional documents were published over the centuries introducing new acupoints.[31]:101 By the 4th century AD, most of the acupuncture sites in use today had been named and identified.[31]:101
