Acupuncture is generally safe when done by appropriately trained practitioners using clean needle technique and single-use needles.[20][21] When properly delivered, it has a low rate of mostly minor adverse effects.[3][20] Accidents and infections do occur, though, and are associated with neglect on the part of the practitioner, particularly in the application of sterile techniques.[11][21] A review conducted in 2013 stated that reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the preceding decade.[22] The most frequently reported adverse events were pneumothorax and infections.[11] Since serious adverse events continue to be reported, it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk.[11]
