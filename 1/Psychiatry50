By the 1970s, however, the psychoanalytic school of thought became marginalized within the field.[121] Biological psychiatry reemerged during this time. Psychopharmacology became an integral part of psychiatry starting with Otto Loewi's discovery of the neuromodulatory properties of acetylcholine; thus identifying it as the first-known neurotransmitter.[122] Neuroimaging was first utilized as a tool for psychiatry in the 1980s.[123] The discovery of chlorpromazine's effectiveness in treating schizophrenia in 1952 revolutionized treatment of the disorder,[124] as did lithium carbonate's ability to stabilize mood highs and lows in bipolar disorder in 1948.[125] Psychotherapy was still utilized, but as a treatment for psychosocial issues.[126]
