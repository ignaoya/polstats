As a result of the increasing interest about the nervous system, several prominent neuroscience organizations have been formed to provide a forum to all neuroscientist during the 20th century. For example, the International Brain Research Organization was founded in 1961,[25] the International Society for Neurochemistry in 1963,[26] the European Brain and Behaviour Society in 1968,[27] and the Society for Neuroscience in 1969.[28] Recently, the application of neuroscience research results has also given rise to applied disciplines as neuroeconomics,[29] neuroeducation,[30] neuroethics,[31] and neurolaw.[32]
