In 1822, the Chinese Emperor signed a decree excluding the practice of acupuncture from the Imperial Medical Institute.[29] He said it was unfit for practice by gentlemen-scholars.[281] In China acupuncture was increasingly associated with lower-class, illiterate practitioners.[282] It was restored for a time, but banned again in 1929 in favor of science-based Western medicine. Although acupuncture declined in China during this time period, it was also growing in popularity in other countries.[32]
