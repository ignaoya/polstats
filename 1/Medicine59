After 750 CE, the Muslim world had the works of Hippocrates, Galen and Sushruta translated into Arabic, and Islamic physicians engaged in some significant medical research. Notable Islamic medical pioneers include the Persian polymath, Avicenna, who, along with Imhotep and Hippocrates, has also been called the "father of medicine".[64] He wrote The Canon of Medicine which became a standard medical text at many medieval European universities,[65] considered one of the most famous books in the history of medicine.[66] Others include Abulcasis,[67] Avenzoar,[68] Ibn al-Nafis,[69] and Averroes.[70] Persian  physician Rhazes[71] was one of the first to question the Greek theory of humorism, which nevertheless remained influential in both medieval Western and medieval Islamic medicine.[72] Some volumes of Rhazes's work Al-Mansuri, namely "On Surgery" and "A General Book on Therapy", became part of the medical curriculum in European universities.[73] Additionally, he has been described as a doctor's doctor,[74] the father of pediatrics,[75][76] and a pioneer of ophthalmology. For example, he was the first to recognize the reaction of the eye's pupil to light.[76] The Persian Bimaristan hospitals were an early example of public hospitals.[77][78]
