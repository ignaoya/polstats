Behavior of nanomaterials are dominated by long ranged non-bonding interactions.[44] Electrochemical processes that occur throughout the brain generate an electric field which can inadvertently affect the behavior of some nanomaterials.[41] Molecular dynamics simulations can mitigate the development phase of nanomaterials as well as prevent neural toxicity of nanomaterials following in vivo clinical trials.[40] Testing nanomaterials using molecular dynamics optimizes nano characteristics for therapeutic purposes by testing different environment conditions, nanomaterial shape fabrications, nanomaterial surface properties, etc. without the need for in vivo experimentation.[45] Flexibility in molecular dynamic simulations allows medical practitioners to personalize treatment. Nanoparticle related data from translational nanoinformatics links neurological patient specific data to predict treatment response.[44]
