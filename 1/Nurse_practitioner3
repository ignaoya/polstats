The present day concept of advanced practice nursing as a primary care provider was created in the mid-1960s, spurred on by a national shortage of physicians.[7] The first formal graduate certificate program for NPs was created by Henry Silver, a physician, and Loretta Ford, a nurse, in 1965.[7] In 1971, The U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Elliot Richardson, made a formal recommendation in expanding the scope of nursing practice to be able to serve as primary care providers.[8] In 2012, discussions have risen between accreditation agencies, national certifying bodies, and state boards of nursing about the possibility of making the Doctorate of Nursing Practice (DNP) as the new minimum standard of education for NP certification and licensure by 2015.[9]
