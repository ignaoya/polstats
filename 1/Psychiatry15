Psychiatry was not a popular career choice among medical students, even though medical school placements are rated favorably.[31] This has resulted in a significant shortage of psychiatrists in the United States and elsewhere.[32] Strategies to address this shortfall have included the use of short 'taster' placements early in the medical school curriculum [31] and attempts to extend psychiatry services further using telemedicine technologies and other methods.[33] Recently, however, there has been an increase in the number of medical students entering into a psychiatry residency. There are several reasons for this surge including the interesting nature of the field, growing interest in genetic biomarkers involved in psychiatric diagnoses, and newer pharmaceuticals on the drug market to treat psychiatric illnesses.[34]
