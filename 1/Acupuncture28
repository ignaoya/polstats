The conclusions of many trials and numerous systematic reviews of acupuncture are largely inconsistent with each other.[14] A 2011 systematic review of systematic reviews found that for reducing pain, real acupuncture was no better than sham acupuncture, and concluded that numerous reviews have shown little convincing evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment for reducing pain.[11] The same review found that neck pain was one of only four types of pain for which a positive effect was suggested, but cautioned that the primary studies used carried a considerable risk of bias.[11] A 2009 overview of Cochrane reviews found acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions.[14]
