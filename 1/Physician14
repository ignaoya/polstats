Primary care physicians guide patients in preventing disease and detecting health problems early while they're still treatable.[11] They are divided into two types: family medicine doctors and internal medicine doctors.[12] Family doctors, or family physicians, are trained to care for patients of any age, while internists are trained to care for adults.[13] Family doctors receive training in a variety of care and are therefore also referred to as general practitioners.[14] Family medicine grew out of the general practitioner movement of the 1960s in response to the growing specialization in medicine that was seen as threatening to the doctor-patient relationship and continuity of care.[15]
