A 2013 review found (without restrictions regarding publication date, study type or language) 295 cases of infections; mycobacterium was the pathogen in at least 96%.[22] Likely sources of infection include towels, hot packs or boiling tank water, and reusing reprocessed needles.[22] Possible sources of infection include contaminated needles, reusing personal needles, a person's skin containing mycobacterium, and reusing needles at various sites in the same person.[22] Although acupuncture is generally considered a safe procedure, a 2013 review stated that the reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the prior decade, including those of mycobacterium.[22] Although it is recommended that practitioners of acupuncture use disposable needles, the reuse of sterilized needles is still permitted.[22] It is also recommended that thorough control practices for preventing infection be implemented and adapted.[22]
