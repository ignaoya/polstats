The use of acupuncture in Germany increased by 20% in 2007, after the German acupuncture trials supported its efficacy for certain uses.[300] In 2011, there were more than one million users,[300] and insurance companies have estimated that two-thirds of German users are women.[300] As a result of the trials, German public health insurers began to cover acupuncture for chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis of the knee, but not tension headache or migraine.[301] This decision was based in part on socio-political reasons.[301] Some insurers in Germany chose to stop reimbursement of acupuncture because of the trials.[302] For other conditions, insurers in Germany were not convinced that acupuncture had adequate benefits over usual care or sham treatments.[303] Highlighting the results of the placebo group, researchers refused to accept a placebo therapy as efficient.[304]
