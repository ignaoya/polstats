When used on children, acupuncture is considered safe when administered by well-trained, licensed practitioners using sterile needles; however, a 2011 review found there was limited research to draw definite conclusions about the overall safety of pediatric acupuncture.[3] The same review found 279 adverse events, 25 of them serious.[3] The adverse events were mostly mild in nature (e.g. bruising or bleeding).[3] The prevalence of mild adverse events ranged from 10.1% to 13.5%, an estimated 168 incidences among 1,422 patients.[3] On rare occasions adverse events were serious (e.g. cardiac rupture or hemoptysis); many might have been a result of substandard practice.[3] The incidence of serious adverse events was 5 per one million, which included children and adults.[3]
