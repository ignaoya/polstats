In addition, Ibn al-Nafis had an insight into what would become a larger theory of the capillary circulation. He stated that "there must be small communications or pores (manafidh in Arabic) between the pulmonary artery and vein," a prediction that preceded the discovery of the capillary system by more than 400 years.[23] Ibn al-Nafis' theory, however, was confined to blood transit in the lungs and did not extend to the entire body.
