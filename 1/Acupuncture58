A 2013 meta-analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was cost-effective as a complement to standard care, but not as a substitute for standard care except in cases where comorbid depression presented.[18] The same meta-analysis found there was no difference between sham and non-sham acupuncture.[18] A 2011 systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain.[19] A 2010 systematic review found that the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture could not be concluded.[100] A 2012 review found that acupuncture seems to be cost-effective for some pain conditions.[246]
