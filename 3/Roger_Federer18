In 2005, Federer failed to reach the finals of the first two Grand Slam tournaments, losing the Australian Open semifinal to eventual champion Safin after holding match points, and the French Open semifinal to eventual champion Rafael Nadal.[50] However, Federer quickly reestablished his dominance on grass, winning the Wimbledon Championships over Andy Roddick.[51] At the US Open, Federer defeated Andre Agassi in the latter's last major final.[52][53]
