Ronaldo made his debut in the Premier League in a 4–0 home victory over Bolton Wanderers on 16 August 2003, receiving a standing ovation when he came on as a substitute.[43] His performance earned praise from George Best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen.[37] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[44] Three other league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,[45] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received his first red card.[46] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 victory over Millwall in the FA Cup final, earning his first trophy.[47] BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final.[48] The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his "elaborate" step-overs in trying to beat a man,[49] but teammate Gary Neville said he was "not a show pony, but the real thing", and predicted he would become a world class player.[50]
