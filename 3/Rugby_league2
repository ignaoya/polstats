Rugby league, often called simply league, is a full-contact sport played by two teams of thirteen players on a rectangular field measuring 68 metres (75 yards) wide and 112–122 metres (122 to 133 yards) long.[1] One of the two codes of rugby football, it originated in Northern England in 1895 as a split from the Rugby Football Union over the issue of payments to the players.[2] Its rules progressively changed with the aim of producing a faster, more entertaining game for spectators.[3]
