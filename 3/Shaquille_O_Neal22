A month before the 2001–02 season's training camp, O'Neal had corrective surgery for a claw toe deformity in the smallest toe of his left foot.[50] He opted against a more involved surgery to return quicker.[51] He was ready for the start of the 2001–02 regular season, but the toe frequently bothered him.[50]
