On 4 September, Jorge Messi, Lionel's father and agent, released a statement in response to La Liga claiming the release clause "is not valid when the termination of the contract is by the player's unilateral decision from the end of the 2019â€“20 season", as stated in Messi's contract with Barcelona;[296] moments later, La Liga issued a response reiterating their statement published on 30 August.[297] Later that evening, Messi announced in an interview with Goal that he would continue at Barcelona for the final year of his contract. In the interview, Messi claimed to have informed Barcelona of his desire to leave multiple times, and club president Josep Bartomeu said Messi could decide at the end of every season if he could stay or leave, only for Bartomeu to refer to the release clause.[298] This left Messi with two options: to stay or go to court against the club, with the player saying "I would never go to court against the club of my life".[299]
