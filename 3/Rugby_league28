In England, rugby league has traditionally been associated with the northern counties of Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumberland where the game originated, especially in towns along the M62 corridor.[8] Its popularity has also increased elsewhere.[51][52][53]  As of 2020[update], only one of the twelve Super League teams are based outside of these traditional counties: Catalans Dragons (Perpignan, France). One other team from outside the United Kingdom, the Toulouse Olympique, competes in the English Rugby League system, although not at the highest tier Super League level, but rather in the Rugby League Championship.
