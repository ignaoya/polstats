Federer turned his sights to the grass courts of Wimbledon, where he breezed his way up to the final.[91] In the championship match he faced long-time rival Andy Roddick in what was their eighth and final meeting at a Grand Slam. Roddick pushed Federer into a record-setting fifth set, which Federer claimed 16â€“14 to win his 15th Grand Slam singles title, breaking the all-time record of Pete Sampras.[92][93]
