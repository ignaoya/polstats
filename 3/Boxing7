The earliest known depiction of boxing comes from a Sumerian relief in Iraq from the 3rd millennium BC.[2] A relief sculpture from Egyptian Thebes (c. 1350 BC) shows both boxers and spectators.[2] These early Middle-Eastern and Egyptian depictions showed contests where fighters were either bare-fisted or had a band supporting the wrist.[2] The earliest evidence of fist fighting with the use of gloves can be found on Minoan Crete (c. 1500â€“1400 BC).[2]
