A prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking  role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing. He has often been described as a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[435][436][437] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[427][438] With his conversion rate from his bending free kicks increasing over time Messi has developed into one of the best free kick exponents in the world.[439]
