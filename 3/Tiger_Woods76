Fluff Cowan served as Woods's caddie from the start of his professional career until Woods dismissed him in March 1999.[182] He was replaced by Steve Williams, who became a close friend of Woods and is often credited with helping him with key shots and putts.[183] In June 2011, Woods dismissed Williams after he caddied for Adam Scott in the U.S. Open[184] and replaced him with friend Bryon Bell on an interim basis. Joe LaCava, a former caddie of both Fred Couples and Dustin Johnson, was hired by Woods shortly after[185] and has remained Woods's caddie since then.
