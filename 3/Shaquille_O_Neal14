O'Neal became a free agent after the 1995–96 NBA season. In the summer of 1996, O'Neal was named to the United States Olympic basketball team, and was later part of the gold medal-winning team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. While the Olympic basketball team was training in Orlando, the Orlando Sentinel published a poll that asked whether the Magic should fire Hill if that were one of O'Neal's conditions for returning.[31][32] 82% answered "no".[31] O'Neal had a power struggle while playing under Hill.[33][34] He said the team "just didn't respect [Hill]."[35] Another question in the poll asked, "Is Shaq worth $115 million?" in reference to the amount of the Magic's offer. 91.3% of the response was "no".[32][33] O'Neal's Olympic teammates teased him over the poll.[32][34] He was also upset that the Orlando media implied O'Neal was not a good role model for having a child with his longtime girlfriend with no immediate plans to marry.[31] O'Neal compared his lack of privacy in Orlando to "feeling like a big fish in a dried-up pond."[36] O'Neal also learned that Hardaway considered himself the leader of the Magic and did not want O'Neal making more money than him.[37]
