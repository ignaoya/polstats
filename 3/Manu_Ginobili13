In contrast to his regular season, Ginóbili became an integral part of Gregg Popovich's rotation in the playoffs, playing in every game.[8] The Spurs eliminated Phoenix and Los Angeles[19] and in those games his scoring threat took opponents by surprise, giving them one more thing to cope with against the now highly favored Spurs. He helped guide them past the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals and then the Brooklyn Nets in the Finals,[19] securing San Antonio's second championship. After the win, Ginóbili won his first Olimpia de Oro ("Golden Olympia") as Argentina's sportsperson of the year,[20] and met Argentine president Néstor Kirchner.[5] A gym in Bahía Blanca was dedicated in Ginóbili's honor as well.[5]
