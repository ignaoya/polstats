Since 1986, it has been common for Argentines abroad to hear Maradona's name as a token of recognition, even in remote places.[42] The Tartan Army sing a version of the Hokey Cokey in honour of the Hand of God goal against England.[322] In Argentina, Maradona is often talked about in terms reserved for legends. In the Argentine film El hijo de la novia ("Son of the Bride"), somebody who impersonates a Catholic priest says to a bar patron, "They idolized him and then crucified him." When a friend scolds him for taking the prank too far, the fake priest retorts, "But I was talking about Maradona." He is the subject of the film El camino de San Diego, though he himself only appears in archive footage.[323]
