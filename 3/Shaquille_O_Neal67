During the 2005 NBA playoffs, O'Neal compared his poor play to Erick Dampier,[162] a Dallas Mavericks center who had failed to score a single point in one of their recent games. The quip inspired countless citations and references by announcers during those playoffs, though Dampier himself offered little response to the insult. The two would meet in the 2006 NBA Finals.[163]
