On February 5, 2015, Woods withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open after another back injury.[103] Woods stated on his website that it was unrelated to his previous surgery and he would take a break from golf until his back healed.[104] He returned for the Masters, finishing in a tie for 17th. In the final round, Woods injured his wrist after his club hit a tree root. He later stated that a bone popped out of his wrist, but he adjusted it back into place and finished the round.[105] Woods then missed the cut at the 2015 U.S. Open and Open Championship, the first time Woods missed the cut at consecutive majors, finishing near the bottom of the leaderboard both times.[106] He finished tied for 18th at the Quicken Loans National on August 2.[107] In late August 2015, Woods played quite well at the Wyndham Championship finishing the tournament at 13-under, only four strokes behind the winner, and tied for 10th place.[108] Woods offered only a brief comment on the speculation that he was still recovering from back surgery, saying it was "just my hip" but offering no specifics.[109]
