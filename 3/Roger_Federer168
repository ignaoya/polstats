Federer's contract with Nike expired in March 2018, and he later signed a deal with Uniqlo.[431] It was reported that Uniqlo signed Federer for roughly $300 million for 10 years ($30 million per year), as opposed to Nike's previous deal with Federer, which was for roughly $10 million per year.[432] However, Federer does not have a shoe deal and chooses to wear Nike trainers.[433]
