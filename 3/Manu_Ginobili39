In 2007, ESPN sportswriter John Hollinger ranked Ginóbili as the sixth-best international player then active in the NBA, describing Ginobili as "one of the great draft heists of all time" and attributing the trend of NBA teams drafting developing European players to the success of the Argentine.[6] The following year, Ginóbili was named by ESPN as one of the best EuroLeague players to have graced the NBA.[80]
