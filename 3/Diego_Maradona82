On 29 March 2007, Maradona was readmitted to a hospital in Buenos Aires. He was treated for hepatitis and effects of alcohol abuse and was released on 11 April, but readmitted two days later.[261] In the following days, there were constant rumours about his health, including three false claims of his death within a month.[262] After being transferred to a psychiatric clinic specializing in alcohol-related problems, Maradona was discharged on 7 May.[263] On 8 May 2007, Maradona appeared on Argentine television and stated that he had quit drinking and had not used drugs in two and a half years.[264] During the 2018 World Cup match between Argentina and Nigeria, Maradona was shown on television cameras behaving extremely erratically, with an abundance of white residue visible on the glass in front of his seat in the stands. The smudges could have been fingerprints, and he later blamed his behaviour on consuming lots of wine.[265]  In January 2019, Maradona underwent surgery after a hernia caused internal bleeding in his stomach.[266]
