In 2007, one study of amateur boxers showed that protective headgear did not prevent brain damage,[64] and another found that amateur boxers faced a high risk of brain damage.[65] The Gothenburg study analyzed temporary levels of neurofilament light in cerebral spinal fluid which they conclude is evidence of damage, even though the levels soon subside. More comprehensive studies of neurological function on larger samples performed by Johns Hopkins University in 1994 and accident rates analyzed by National Safety Council in 2017 show amateur boxing is a comparatively safe sport.[66][67]
