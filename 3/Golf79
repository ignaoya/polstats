It was not until 1552 that the first woman golfer played the game. Mary Queen of Scots commissioned St. Andrew's Links.[61] However, it was not until the 20th century that women were taken seriously and eventually broke the "Gentlemen Only, Ladies Forbidden" rule. Many men saw women as unfit to play the sport due to their supposed lack of strength and ability.
