On 18 June 2016, in the quarter-final of the Copa América against Venezuela, Messi produced another man of the match performance,[377] assisting two goals and scoring another in a 4–1 victory, which enabled him to equal Gabriel Batistuta's national record of 54 goals in official international matches.[378] This record was broken three days later when Messi scored a free kick in a 4–0 semi-final win against hosts the United States; he also assisted two goals during the match as Argentina sealed a place in the final of the competition for a second consecutive year,[379] and was named man of the match once again.[380]
