A controversial figure in the sport, while he earned critical acclaim from players, pundits, and managers over his playing style, he also drew criticism in the media for his temper and confrontational behaviour, both on and off the pitch.[187][188][189] However, in 2005, Paolo Maldini, described Maradona both as the greatest player he ever faced, and also as the most honest, stating: "He was a model of good behaviour on the pitch – he was respectful of everyone, from the great players down to the ordinary team member. He was always getting kicked around and he never complained – not like some of today's strikers."[190] His former club and international teammate, Franco Baresi, stated when he was asked who was his greatest opponent: "Maradona; when he was on form, there was almost no way of stopping him,"[60] while fellow former Italy defender Giuseppe Bergomi described Maradona as the greatest player of all time in 2018.[191] Zlatan Ibrahimović said his off-field antics do not matter, and he should only be judged for the impact he made on the field. "For me Maradona is more than football. What he did as a footballer, in my opinion, he will be remembered forever. When you see number 10 who do you think about? Maradona. It is a symbol, even today there are those who choose that number for him."[192]
