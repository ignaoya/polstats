Tiger Woods Design has taken on two other courses, neither of which has materialized. In August 2007, Woods announced The Cliffs at High Carolina, a private course in the Blue Ridge Mountains near Asheville, North Carolina.[199] After a groundbreaking in November 2008, the project suffered cash flow problems and suspended construction.[197] A third course, in Punta Brava, Mexico, was announced in October 2008, but incurred delays due to issues with permits and an environmental impact study.[197][200] Construction on the Punta Brava course has not yet begun.[197]
