On 23 July 2016, following Portugal's triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport.[499] The unveiling of the rebranded terminal took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented.[500] The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust's likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including Saturday Night Live,[501] while the name change was subject to much debate locally by some politicians and citizens, who even started a petition against the move, an action criticised by President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque.[502][500] A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust.[503] However, this bust was never used; instead, a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018.[504]
