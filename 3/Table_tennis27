In addition to games between individual players, pairs may also play table tennis. Singles and doubles are both played in international competition, including the Olympic Games since 1988 and the Commonwealth Games since 2002.[45] In 2005, the ITTF announced that doubles table tennis only was featured as a part of team events in the 2008 Olympics.
