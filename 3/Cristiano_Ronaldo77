Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Lionel Messi.[note 5] Winning his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history.[417] Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring,[note 6] he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer,[418] especially in important and high-pressured situations.[note 7]
