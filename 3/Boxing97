Knocking a person unconscious or even causing a concussion may cause permanent brain damage.[54] There is no clear division between the force required to knock a person out and the force likely to kill a person.[55] From 1980 to 2007, more than 200 amateur boxers, professional boxers and Toughman fighters died due to ring or training injuries.[56] In 1983, editorials in the Journal of the American Medical Association called for a ban on boxing.[57] The editor, Dr. George Lundberg, called boxing an "obscenity" that "should not be sanctioned by any civilized society."[58] Since then, the British,[59] Canadian[60] and Australian[61] Medical Associations have called for bans on boxing.
