Maradona voiced support for Bolivia's ousted president Evo Morales[271] and was also a supporter of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. In 2005, he came to Venezuela to meet Chávez, who received him in the Miraflores Palace. After the meeting, Maradona said that he had come to meet a "great man" (un grande, which can also mean "a big man", in Spanish), but had instead met a gigantic man (un gigante). He also stated, "I believe in Chávez, I am a Chavista. Everything Fidel does, everything Chávez does, for me is the best."[272] Maradona was Chávez's guest of honour at the opening game of the 2007 Copa América held in Venezuela.[273]
