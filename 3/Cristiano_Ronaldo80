Ronaldo has adopted several goalscoring celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin.[430][431][432] However, after scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a "storming jump" and "turn", before "landing in spread-eagled fashion"[431] into his "signature power stance",[432] while usually simultaneously exclaiming "SÃ­" (Spanish and Italian for "yes");[430][433] as such, this trademark celebration has been dubbed the "Sii!" in the media.[430][431][434]
