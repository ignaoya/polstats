English public schools were the first to codify football games. In particular, they devised the first offside rules, during the late 18th century.[54] In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were "off their side" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective. Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a scrum or similar formation. However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, Rugby, Harrow and Cheltenham, during between 1810 and 1850.[54] The first known codes – in the sense of a set of rules – were those of Eton in 1815[55] and Aldenham in 1825.[55])
