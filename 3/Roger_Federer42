At the French Open, Federer won his 700th tour match and 150th tour match on clay.[97][99] However, he failed to reach a Grand Slam semifinal for the first time since the 2004 French Open,[100] losing to Söderling in the last 8 and relinquishing his No. 1 ranking,[97] having been just one week away from equalling Pete Sampras's record of 286 weeks as world No. 1. In a huge upset at Wimbledon, Federer lost in the last 8 again to Tomáš Berdych and fell to No. 3 in the rankings for the first time in 6 years and 8 months.[97][101][102]
