Following on from their poor qualification campaign, salvaged by Messi, expectations were not high going into the 2018 World Cup, with the team, without an injured Messi, losing 6–1 to Spain in March 2018.[400][401] Prior to Argentina's opener, there was speculation in the media over whether this would be Messi's final World Cup.[402] In the team's opening group match against Iceland on 16 June, Messi missed a potential match-winning penalty in an eventual 1–1 draw.[403] In Argentina's second game of the 2018 World Cup on 21 June, the team lost 3–0 to Croatia. Post match the Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli spoke of the lack of quality in the team surrounding Messi, "the reality of the Argentina squad clouds his [Messi's] brilliance".[404] Messi had just 49 touches of the ball and only two inside the Croatia penalty area.[405] Sampaoli stated, "we quite simply couldn't pass to him to help him generate the situations he is used to. We worked to give him the ball but the opponent also worked hard to prevent him from getting the ball. We lost that battle."[404] Croatia midfielder Luka Modrić also stated post match, "Messi is an incredible player but he can't do everything alone."[405]
