O'Neal was raised by a Baptist mother and a Muslim stepfather.[274] Both Robin Wright in her book Rock the Casbah as well as the Los Angeles Times have identified O'Neal as a Muslim.[275][276][277] However, O'Neal has said, "I'm Muslim, I'm Jewish, I'm Buddhist, I'm everybody 'cause I'm a people person."[278]
