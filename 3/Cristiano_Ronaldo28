Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time, of £80 million (€94 million).[115] His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause.[116] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[117] Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at Manchester United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,[118] which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[119]
