Games are played in four quarters of 10 (FIBA)[37] or 12 minutes (NBA).[38] College men's games use two 20-minute halves,[39] college women's games use 10-minute quarters,[40] and most United States high school varsity games use 8-minute quarters; however, this varies from state to state.[41][42] 15 minutes are allowed for a half-time break under FIBA, NBA, and NCAA rules[39][43][44] and 10 minutes in United States high schools.[41] Overtime periods are five minutes in length[39][45][46] except for high school, which is four minutes in length.[41] Teams exchange baskets for the second half. The time allowed is actual playing time; the clock is stopped while the play is not active. Therefore, games generally take much longer to complete than the allotted game time, typically about two hours.
