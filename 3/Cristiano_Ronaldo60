Ronaldo scored seven goals in the qualification for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a "group of death".[310] In the last group stage game against the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2–1 victory.[311] He scored a header in the quarter-final against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1–0 win.[312] In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match.[313][314] After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, with Ronaldo having sent three shots over the bar,[315] Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shoot-out. Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot,[316] a decision that was questioned by the media[317] and later criticized by Frank Wagner and Beau Bourne of Bleacher Report, Graham MacAree of SB Nation and by Yahoo Sports' Martin Rogers.[318][319][320][321] Ronaldo's own teammate, Nani, said that Ronaldo "demanded" to take the last penalty.[322] As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.[323]
