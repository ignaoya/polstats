While Barcelona began a gradual decline, the 19-year-old Messi established himself as one of the best players in the world during the 2006–07 campaign.[61][62] Already an idol to the culés, the club's supporters, he scored 17 goals  in 36 games across all competitions.[62][63] However, he continued to be plagued by major injuries; a metatarsal fracture sustained on 12 November 2006 kept him out of action for three months.[64][65] He recovered in time for the last 16 round of the Champions League against Liverpool, but was effectively marked out of the game; Barcelona, the reigning champions, were out of the competition.[66] In the league, his goal contribution increased towards the end of the season; 11 of his 14 goals came from the last 13 games.[63] On 10 March 2007, he scored his first hat-trick in a Clásico, the first player to do so in 12 years, equalising after each goal by Real Madrid to end the match in a 3–3 draw in injury time.[67] His growing importance to the club was reflected in a new contract, signed that month, which greatly increased his wages.[68]
