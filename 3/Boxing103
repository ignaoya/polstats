With a careful and thoughtful approach, boxing can be quite beneficial to health. For example, Gemma Ruegg, a two-weight regional champion from Bournemouth in Dorset, boxed throughout her pregnancy and returned to the ring three weeks after giving birth to her daughter. Earlier, boxing helped her to get rid of alcohol addiction and depression.[73]
