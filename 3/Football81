Over the years, Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. In 1903, the Ontario Rugby Football Union adopted the Burnside rules, which implemented the line of scrimmage and down-and-distance system from American football, among others.[122] Canadian football then implemented the legal forward pass in 1929.[123] American and Canadian football remain different codes, stemming from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side has not.
