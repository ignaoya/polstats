Woods had a much anticipated return to golf in 2009, when he performed well. His comeback included a spectacular performance at the 2009 Presidents Cup, but he failed to win a major, the first year since 2004 that he had not done so.[83] After his marital infidelities came to light and received massive media coverage at the end of 2009 (see further details below), Woods announced in December that he would be taking an indefinite break from competitive golf.[7] In February 2010, he delivered a televised apology for his behavior, saying "I was wrong and I was foolish."[84] During this period, several companies ended their endorsement deals with Woods.[85]
