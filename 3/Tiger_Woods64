Woods has spent the most consecutive and cumulative weeks atop the world rankings. He is one of five players (along with Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, and Jack Nicklaus) to have won all four major championships in his career, known as the Career Grand Slam, and was the youngest to do so.[171] Woods is the only player to have consecutively won all four major championships open to professionals, accomplishing the feat in the 2000â€“2001 seasons.
