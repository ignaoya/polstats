In the 2006–07 season, O'Neal missed 35 games after an injury to his left knee in November required surgery.[73][74] After one of those missed games, a Christmas Day match-up against the Lakers, he ripped Jackson, who O'Neal had once called a second father, referring to his former coach as "Benedict Arnold". Jackson had previously said, "The only person I've ever [coached] that hasn't been a worker ... is probably Shaq."[75] The Heat struggled during O'Neal's absence,[76] but with his return won seven of their next eight games. Bad luck still haunted the squad, however, as Wade dislocated his left shoulder, leaving O'Neal as the focus of the team.[76] Critics doubted that O'Neal, now in his mid-30s, could carry the team into the playoffs.[77] The Heat went on a winning streak that kept them in the race for a playoff spot, which they finally secured against the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 5.[76]
