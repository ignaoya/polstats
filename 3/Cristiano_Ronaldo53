On 20 July, Ronaldo scored twice in a 2–1 home win over Lazio; his first goal was his 50th in Serie A. He became the second fastest player to reach this landmark, after Gunnar Nordahl, and the first player in history to reach 50 goals in the Premier League, La Liga, and Serie A. With his brace, he also reached 30 league goals for the season, becoming just the third player in Juventus's history to reach that milestone in a single season,[265][266] after Felice Borel in 1933–34 and John Hansen in 1951–52. Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of 35 years and 166 days, to score more than 30 goals in one of the five top European leagues since Ronnie Rooke with Arsenal in 1948.[267] On 26 July, he scored the opening goal in a 2–0 home win over Sampdoria, which saw Juventus crowned Serie A champions for a ninth consecutive time.[268] He finished his second Serie A campaign with a total of 31 goals and 6 assists, which made him the second–highest goalscorer in the league behind only European Golden Shoe winner Ciro Immobile, with 36 goals, who also equaled Gonzalo Higuaín's record for most goals in a single Serie A season.[269][270] On 7 August, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 2–1 home win against Lyon in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, which saw him finish the season with 37 goals in all competitions; the tally allowed him to break Felice Borel's club record of 36 goals in a single season, which he had set in 1933–34.[271] However, despite the victory, Juventus tied with Lyon 2–2 on aggregate, and were eliminated from the competition on the away goals rule.[272]
