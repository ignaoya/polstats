Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[478][479] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world:[163] since 2008, Messi has won six Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five,[480] six FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four.[481] Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players;[163][482] beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques – Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1 1⁄2 in) with a muscular build – and contrasting public personalities, with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility.[483][484][485] From 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events.[486] Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.[486]
