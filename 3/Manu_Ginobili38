Having traversed the major basketball continents during his career, Gin√≥bili is one of the few players who enjoyed success under both the physical, one-on-one play of the NBA and the more technical, jump-shooting rule set of FIBA. He is one of only two players in basketball history (along with Bill Bradley) to win the EuroLeague,[77] an Olympic gold medal, and an NBA championship ring.[14][78] He is also the first non-U.S. player to win both the NBA championship ring and the Olympic gold medal, and the second Latin American to be selected to play in an NBA All-Star game (after Panama's Rolando Blackman).[78] The Spurs made the NBA playoffs in each of Ginobili's 16 NBA seasons.[79]
