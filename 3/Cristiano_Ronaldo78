Ronaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning, and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader.[419][420] Writing of his "extraordinary commitment to physical preparation", Adam Bate of Sky Sports adds, "Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game."[398] His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside Pel√© and Diego Maradona once retiring.[421] He has at times, however, been criticised for simulating when tackled.[note 8] In addition to this, he was occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates, and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player.[422][423]
