Like all male Swiss citizens, Federer was subject to compulsory military service in the Swiss Armed Forces. However, in 2003 he was ruled "unsuitable" and was subsequently not required to fulfill his military obligation.[11] Instead, he served in the civil protection force and was required to pay 3% of his taxable income as an alternative.[12] He grew up supporting FC Basel and the Swiss national football team.[13] Federer also credits his hand-eye coordination to the wide range of sports he played as a child, including badminton and basketball.[14]
