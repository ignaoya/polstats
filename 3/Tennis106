By the early twenty-first century, the "Big Three" of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic had dominated.[122][123]
Roger Federer is considered by many observers to have the most "complete" game in modern tennis. He has won 20 grand slam titles and 6 World Tour Finals, the most for any male player. Many experts of tennis, former tennis players and his own tennis peers believe Federer is the greatest player in the history of the game.[124][125][126][127][128][129] Federer's biggest rival Rafael Nadal is regarded as the greatest competitor in tennis history by some former players and is regarded to have the potential to be the greatest of all time.[130][131] Nadal is regarded as the greatest clay court player of all time.[132] Novak Djokovic is also considered to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time and the most dominant of the 2010s decade, being the first male player since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four major titles at once, the only player to achieve the Career Golden Masters, and amassing a superior head-to-head record against Federer and Nadal.[133]
