One of Maradona's trademark moves was dribbling full-speed on the right wing, and on reaching the opponent's goal line, delivering accurate passes to his teammates. Another trademark was the rabona, a reverse-cross pass shot behind the leg that holds all the weight.[147] This manoeuvre led to several assists, such as the cross for Ramón Díaz's header against Switzerland in 1980.[148] He was also a dangerous free kick and penalty kick taker, who was renowned for his ability to bend the ball from corners and direct set pieces.[149][150][151] Regarded as one of the best dead-ball specialists of all time,[152][153][154][155] his free kick technique, which often saw him raise his knee at a high angle when striking the ball, thus enabling him to lift it high over the wall, allowed him to score free kicks even from close range, within 22 to 17 yards (20 to 16 metres) from the goal, or even just outside the penalty area.[156] His style of taking free kicks influenced several other specialists, including Gianfranco Zola,[154] Andrea Pirlo,[157] and Lionel Messi.[158]
