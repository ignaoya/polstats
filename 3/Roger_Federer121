Federer and Andy Roddick played 24 times, and Federer leads their head-to-head 21â€“3. Roddick lost his No. 1 ranking to Federer after Federer won his first Australian Open in 2004. Their rivalry includes four Grand Slam event finals, three at Wimbledon and one at the US Open, all won by Federer.[319] Roddick himself said it was not much of a rivalry, being so one-sided.[320]
