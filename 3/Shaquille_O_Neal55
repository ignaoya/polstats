At 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m), 330 lb (150 kg)[134] and U.S. shoe size 23,[56] he became famous for his physical stature. His physical frame gave him a power advantage over most opponents. On two occasions during his first season in the NBA, his powerful dunks broke the steel backboard supports, prompting the league to increase the brace strength and stability of the backboards for the following 1993–94 season.[135]
