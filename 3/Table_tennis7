Although both a "Table Tennis Association" and a "Ping Pong Association" existed by 1910,[10] a new Table Tennis Association was founded in 1921, and in 1926 renamed the English Table Tennis Association.[11] The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) followed in 1926.[1][12] London hosted the first official World Championships in 1926. In 1933, the United States Table Tennis Association, now called USA Table Tennis, was formed.[1][13]
