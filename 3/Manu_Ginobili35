Apart from his up-tempo and aggressive style, Ginóbili was known for his clutch play.[4][73] Ginóbili's go-to move was either a 3-pointer or a fierce drive to the basket. He often lowered his head when driving to the basket to collapse defenses and create shots or passes to his teammates. Ginobili popularized the Euro step in the NBA, although he was not the first to use the move in the league.[74]
