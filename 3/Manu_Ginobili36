Ginobili was known as a team player. He accepted the Spurs coaches' decision to bring him off the bench for most of his career.[18] He was also known for his difficult-to-defend passes, including the no-look pass.[18] Ginobili was also willing to draw charges on defense.[4] In 2007, he was listed by ESPN writer Thomas Neumann at No. 6 on the list of greatest floppers in NBA history.[75] Five years later, Ian Thomsen, a Sports Illustrated columnist, grouped Ginóbili with fellow European league players Anderson Varejão and Vlade Divac as the players who "made [flopping] famous", by exaggerating contact on the court in a manner analogous to diving in soccer games.[76]
