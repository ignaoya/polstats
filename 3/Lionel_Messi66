Following growing dissatisfaction with the direction of Barcelona on and off the field,[290] Barcelona announced that Messi sent the club "a document expressing his desire to leave" on 25 August 2020.[291] The announcement garnered a significant media response, including from current and former teammates (who supported Messi's statement) and Catalan president Quim Torra.[292] On August 26, Barcelona's sporting director Ramon Planes iterated the club's desire to "build a team around the most important player in the world"[293] and affirmed Messi will only be able to leave should a buyer pay his €700 million buyout clause; a reported early termination option available in Messi's contract (which would have allowed him to leave the club for free) could only be exercised if he had communicated his decision to Barcelona by 31 May 2020, although the player's representatives argued the deadline should be set to 31 August, due to the adjourned 2019–20 season.[294] On 30 August, La Liga issued a statement stating Messi's contract and buyout clause are still active.[295]
