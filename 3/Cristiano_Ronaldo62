Ronaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury,[329][330] potentially risking his career.[331] Ronaldo later commented: "If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don't."[332] Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice,[333] Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, though he was unable to prevent a 4–0 defeat.[334] After assisting an injury-time 2–2 equaliser against the United States,[335] he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2–1 victory over Ghana.[336] His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups.[337] Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.[336]
