An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at Ulgham, Northumberland, England:  "Henry... while playing at ball.. ran against David".[37]  Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a "football game" at Newcastle, County Down being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard.[38]  Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 at Shouldham, Norfolk, England: "[d]uring the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his... ran against him and wounded himself".[37]
