At the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition,[70] finding the net twice in a 7–1 victory over Roma.[71] He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3–2 win,[72] but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3–0 at the San Siro.[73] He also helped United reach the FA Cup final, but the decisive match against Chelsea ended in a 1–0 defeat.[74] Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May 2007 (his 50th goal for the club), as Manchester United claimed their first Premier League title in four years.[75] As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player, and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award,[76][77] becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours.[78] His club wages were concurrently upgraded to £120,000 a week (£31 million total) as part of a five-year contract extension with United.[79] At the end of 2007, Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the Ballon d'Or,[80] and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the FIFA World Player of the Year award.[81]
