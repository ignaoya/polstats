He also received media flak for mocking Chinese people when interviewed about newcomer center Yao Ming. O'Neal told a reporter, "you tell Yao Ming, ching chong yang, wah, ah so."[158] O'Neal later said it was locker room humor and he meant no offense. Yao believed that O'Neal was joking, but he said many Asians wouldn't see the humor.[159] Yao joked, "Chinese is hard to learn. I had trouble with it when I was little."[160] O'Neal later admitted that he regretted how he treated Yao early in his career.[161]
