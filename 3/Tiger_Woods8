Earl was a retired U.S. Army officer, and Vietnam War veteran; he was born to African American parents, and was also said to have had European, Native American, and possibly Chinese, ancestry.[21][22] Kultida (n√©e Punsawad) is originally from Thailand, where Earl had met her when he was on a tour of duty there in 1968. She is of mixed Thai, Chinese, and Dutch ancestry.[23] Tiger has described his ethnic make-up as "Cablinasian" (a syllabic abbreviation he coined from Caucasian, Black, American Indian, and Asian).[24]
