Ronaldo was Portugal's second-highest scorer in their qualification group for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with seven goals.[285] During the tournament, he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a penalty kick in Portugal's second match of the group stage.[286] In Portugal's round of 16 match against the Netherlands, an infamously dirty game, Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half, following a tackle from Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz. Following Portugal's 1–0 victory in the match, Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him, although he was able to recover in time to participate in the next round.[287] In Portugal's quarter-final against England, Ronaldo's Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction,[288] the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal.[289] Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals.[290] Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1–0 semi-final defeat to France.[291] FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision.[292] Following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008, scoring two goals in the process.[293][294]
