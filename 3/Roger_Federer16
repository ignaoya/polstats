During 2004, Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles for the first time in his career and became the first person to do so since Mats Wilander in 1988. His first major hard-court title came at the Australian Open over Marat Safin, thereby becoming the world No. 1 for the first time.[45] He then won his second Wimbledon crown over Andy Roddick.[46] Federer defeated the 2001 US Open champion, Lleyton Hewitt, at the US Open for his first title there.[47]
