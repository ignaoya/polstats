A versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch,[380] and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet.[381] He ranks among the world's fastest footballers, both with and without the ball.[382] Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility, and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints,[382][383] such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark;[384] he has also been known to use the flipâ€“flap.[385]
