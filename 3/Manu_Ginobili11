Ginóbili joined the Spurs for the 2002–03 NBA season, where he played backup for veteran guard Steve Smith.[5] He spent much of the early season injured, and found it hard to adjust to the NBA's style of play. As his injury improved, so did Ginóbili, winning the Western Conference Rookie of the Month in March, and being named to the All-Rookie Second Team at the end of the season.[8] Still, he only started in five games as the Spurs chalked up a 60–22 regular season win–loss record.[16][17] The Spurs then entered the playoffs eager to upend the defending champions Los Angeles Lakers, at which point Ginóbili rose to prominence.
