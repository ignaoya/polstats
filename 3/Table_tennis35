The shakehand grip is so-named because the racket is grasped as if one is performing a handshake.[49] Though it is sometimes referred to as the "tennis" or "Western" grip, it bears no relation to the Western tennis grip, which was popularized on the West Coast of the United States in which the racket is rotated 90Â°, and played with the wrist turned so that on impact the knuckles face the target.  In table tennis, "Western" refers to Western nations, for this is the grip that players native to Europe and the Americas have almost exclusively employed.
