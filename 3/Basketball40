A regulation basketball court in international games is 91.9 feet (28.0 meters) long and 49.2 feet (15 meters) wide. In the NBA and NCAA the court is 94 by 50 feet (29 by 15 meters).[35] Most courts have wood flooring, usually constructed from maple planks running in the same direction as the longer court dimension.[51][52] The name and logo of the home team is usually painted on or around the center circle.
