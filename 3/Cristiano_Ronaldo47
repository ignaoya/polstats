Despite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract,[235] on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a €100 million transfer, which included an additional €12 million in other fees,[236] and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs. The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old,[237] and the highest paid by an Italian club.[238] Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid,[239] but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino Pérez.[240]
