The Asia-Pacific Rugby League Confederation's purpose is to spread the sport of rugby league throughout their region along with other governing bodies such as the ARL and NZRL.[43] Since rugby league was introduced to Australia in 1908,
it has become the largest television sport and 3rd most attended sport in Australia.[44] Neighbouring Papua New Guinea is one of two countries to have rugby league as its national sport (with Cook Islands).[6][7] Australia's elite club competition also features a team from Auckland, New Zealand's biggest city. Rugby league is the dominant winter sport in the eastern Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland.[45] The game is also among the predominant sports of Tonga[46] and is played in other Pacific nations such as Samoa and Fiji. Researchers have found that rugby league has been able to help with improving development in the islands.[47] In Australia, and indeed the rest of the region, the annual State of Origin series ranks among the most popular sporting events.[48][49]
