O'Neal said he didn't "compete with little guys who run around dominating the ball, throwing up 30 shots a night—like D–Wade, Kobe." O'Neal added that he was only competing against Duncan: "If Tim Duncan gets five rings, then that gives some writer the chance to say 'Duncan is the best,' and I can't have that."[111] Publicly, he insisted he did not care whether he started or substituted for the Celtics, but expected to be part of the second unit.[111] Privately, he wanted to start, but kept it to himself.[112] O'Neal missed games throughout the season due to an assortment of ailments to his right leg[113] including knee,[114] calf,[115] hip,[116] and Achilles injuries.[117] The Celtics traded away center Kendrick Perkins in February partially due to the expectation that O'Neal would return to fill Perkins' role. The Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury,[113] and they were 19–3 in games that O'Neal played over 20 minutes.[118] After requesting a cortisone shot, O'Neal returned April 3 after missing 27 games due to his Achilles; he played only five minutes due to a strained right calf.[113][119] It was the last regular season game he would play that year.[120] O'Neal missed the first round of the 2011 playoffs. He insisted on more cortisone shots and returned in the second round, but he was limited to 12 minutes in two games as the Heat eliminated the Celtics from the playoffs.[121][122]
