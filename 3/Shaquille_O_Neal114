In 2015, Shareef was seen in high school basketball highlights as a 6-foot-7-inch (2.01Â m) freshman power forward, and had been described to have "polar opposite playing style to his father" due to his more athletic build and better shooting range.[280][281] Shareef, later rated as a top-30 prospect in the recruiting class of 2018, had committed to play college basketball at the University of Arizona, but rescinded the commitment in February 2018 after Arizona head coach Sean Miller was linked to potential major violations of NCAA recruiting rules.[282]
