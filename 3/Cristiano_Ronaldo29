Ronaldo made his debut in La Liga on 29 August 2009, against Deportivo La Coruña, and scored from the penalty spot in Madrid's 3–2 home win.[120] He scored in each of his first four league fixtures with the club, the first Madrid player to do so.[121] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich.[122] His strong start to the season, however, was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.[123][124] A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almería.[125] Midway through the season, Ronaldo placed second in the running for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, behind Lionel Messi of Barcelona, Madrid's historic rivals. He finished the campaign with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in the Spanish competition.[126][127] His first season at Real Madrid ended trophyless.[128]
