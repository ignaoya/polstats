Ahead of the 2008–09 season, on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery,[99] which kept him out of action for 10 weeks.[100] Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5–0 win against Stoke City on 15 November,[101] which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time.[102] At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan,[103] assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process.[104] He subsequently became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since George Best in 1968,[105] and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.[106]
