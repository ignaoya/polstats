O'Neal came from a tall family—his biological father stood 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) and his mother was 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) tall—and by age 13 O'Neal was already 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) tall. O'Neal credits the Boys & Girls Clubs of America in Newark with giving him a safe place to play and keeping him off the streets. "It gave me something to do," he said. "I'd just go there to shoot. I didn't even play on a team."[16] Because of his stepfather's career in the military, the family left Newark, moving to military bases in Germany and Texas.[17]
