Federer has played in an era where he dominated men's tennis together with Nadal and Novak Djokovic, who have been collectively referred to as the Big Three and are widely considered three of the greatest male tennis players of all-time.[c] A Wimbledon junior champion in 1998, Federer won his first Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon in 2003 at age 21. In 2004, he established himself as the best player in men's tennis by winning three out of four major singles titles and the ATP Finals,[d] a feat he repeated in 2006 and 2007. From 2005 to 2010, Federer made 18 out of 19 major singles finals. During this span, he won his fifth consecutive titles at both Wimbledon and the US Open. He completed the career Grand Slam at the 2009 French Open after three previous runner-ups to Nadal, his main rival up until 2010. At age 27, he also surpassed Pete Sampras's then-record of 14 Grand Slam men's singles titles at Wimbledon in 2009.
