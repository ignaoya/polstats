As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[23] where his father was the kit man,[18] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of Â£1,500.[24] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting youth football academy.[24] By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally, and agreed with his mother to cease his education in order to focus entirely on football.[25] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him.[25] However, one year later, he was diagnosed with a racing heart, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[26] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[27] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[28][29]
