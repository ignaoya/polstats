The IHF defines 18 hand signals for quick visual communication with players and officials. The signal for warning is accompanied by a yellow card.[13] A disqualification for the game is indicated by a red card,[14] followed by a blue card if the disqualification will be accompanied by a report.[15] The referees also use whistle blows to indicate infractions or to restart the play.
