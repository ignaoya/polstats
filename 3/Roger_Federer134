Federer and Rafael Nadal have won more Grand Slam tournament titles (20) than any other men's singles players.[336][337] He is the first men's singles player to have reached ten consecutive Grand Slam tournament finals and a total of 31 Grand Slam finals.[338][339] He has earned a men's doubles gold medal, and a men's single silver medal at the Olympics in 2008 and 2012, respectively.[340] He has spent the second-most time at the top of the ATP Rankings (310 weeks). He also holds the record for the most titles (6) at the year-end tournament, where only the year-end eight highest-ranked players participate. Federer was ranked among the top eight players in the world continuously for 14 years and two weeksâ€”from 14 October 2002 until 31 October 2016, when injuries forced him to skip much of the 2016 season.[341]
