Since May 2004, citing his close ties with South Africa (his mother is South African) he has been supporting the South Africa-Swiss charity IMBEWU, which helps children better connect to sports as well as social and health awareness. In 2005, Federer visited South Africa to meet the children that had benefited from his support.[375][376][377] Also in 2005, he auctioned his racquet from his US Open championship to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina.[378]
