During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a "one-fingered gesture" towards Benfica fans,[57] and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3â€“1 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole.[58] Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play.[59] Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off,[60] Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident.[61] United, however, denied the possibility of him leaving the club.[62]
