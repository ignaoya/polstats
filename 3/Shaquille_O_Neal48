Upon hearing Bryant comment that he had more rings than O'Neal, Wyc Grousbeck, principal owner of the Celtics, saw an opportunity to acquire O'Neal.[103] Celtics coach Doc Rivers agreed to the signing on the condition that O'Neal would not receive preferential treatment, nor could he cause any locker room problems like in Los Angeles or Miami.[104] On August 4, 2010, the Celtics announced that they had signed O'Neal.[105] The contract was for two years at the veteran minimum salary for a total contract value of $2.8Â million.[106] O'Neal wanted the larger mid-level exception contract, but the Celtics chose instead to give it to Jermaine O'Neal.[107] The Atlanta Hawks and the Dallas Mavericks also expressed interest but had stalled on O'Neal's salary demands.[108][109] He was introduced by the Celtics on August 10, 2010, and chose the number 36.[110]
