Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season,[63] it proved to be his breakout year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach René Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball, and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known.[64] He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a victory that put United on top of the league), Wigan Athletic and Reading.[65][66][67] Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.[68][69]
