During the 2004–05 season, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games throughout the campaign and scoring on six occasions.[39][45] Since his debut the previous November, he had not been called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him.[39] Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.[46][47] Messi made his league debut during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol, coming on in the 82nd minute.[24] At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.[41] As a substitute player, he played 77 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the UEFA Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk.[45][48] He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005, against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming – at that time – the youngest-ever scorer for the club.[46][49] Barcelona, in their second season under Rijkaard, won the league for the first time in six years.[50]
