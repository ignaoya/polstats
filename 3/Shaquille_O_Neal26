O'Neal missed the first 12 games of the 2002–03 season recovering from toe surgery.[56] He was sidelined with hallux rigidus, a degenerative arthritis in his toe.[57] He waited the whole summer until just before training camp for the surgery and explained, "I got hurt on company time, so I'll heal on company time."[58] O'Neal debated whether to have a more invasive surgery that would have kept him out an additional three months, but he opted against the more involved procedure.[57] The Lakers started the season with a record of 11–19.[59] At the end of the season, the Lakers had fallen to the fifth seed and failed to reach the Finals in 2003.
