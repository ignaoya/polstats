Ronaldo became Manchester United's first Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003–04 season.[38] His transfer fee of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[39] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[40] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[41] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be his manager, Alex Ferguson, of whom he later said, "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."[42]
