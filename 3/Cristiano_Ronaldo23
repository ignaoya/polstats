Ronaldo scored his first and only hat-trick for Manchester United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, bringing United up to the top of the Premier League table.[82] A month later, on 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton, and scored both goals of the match.[83] His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, which bettered George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967–68 season, thus setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder.[84] His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot,[85] as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award.[86] He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season.[87][88]
