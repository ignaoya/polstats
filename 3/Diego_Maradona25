Napoli would win their second league title in 1989–90, and finish runners up in the league twice, in 1987–88 and 1988–89.[49] Other honours during the Maradona era at Napoli included the Coppa Italia in 1987 (as well as a second-place finish in the Coppa Italia in 1989), the UEFA Cup in 1989, and the Italian Supercup in 1990.[49] During the 1989 UEFA Cup Final against Stuttgart, Maradona scored from a penalty in a 2–1 home victory in the first leg, later assisting Careca's match–winning goal,[53][54] while in the second leg on 17 May – a 3–3 away draw –, he assisted Ciro Ferrara's goal with a header.[55][56] Despite primarily playing in a creative role as an attacking midfielder, Maradona was the top scorer in Serie A in 1987–88 with 15 goals, and was the all-time leading goalscorer for Napoli, with 115 goals,[57] until his record was broken by Marek Hamšík in 2017.[36][58][59] When asked who was the toughest player he ever faced, A.C. Milan central defender Franco Baresi stated it was Maradona, a view shared by his Milan teammate Paolo Maldini.[60][61]
