The Agassiâ€“Sampras rivalry was the best rivalry of the 1990s. Andre Agassi, the first of two male players in history to have achieved a Career Golden Slam in singles tennis (followed by Rafael Nadal), has been called the best service returner in the history of the game.[115][116][117][118] Agassi was the first man to win grand slams on all modern surfaces (previous holders of all grand slam tournaments played in an era of grass and clay only), and is regarded by a number of critics and fellow players to be among the greatest players of all time.[115][119][120] Both Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall also won major Pro Slam tournaments on all three surfaces (grass, clay, hard court) Rosewall in 1963 and Laver in 1967.[121] Pete Sampras had a precise and powerful serve, set the record of six year-end No.1 finishes (matched by Novak Djokovic, albeit Sampras did so consecutively), and was the first player to break Roy Emerson's record of twelve Grand Slams. Sampras retired with a then-Open era record of fourteen Grand Slam titles which was by far the most among his contemporaries, as the second-most Slams held at the time by another active player was Agassi with seven.
