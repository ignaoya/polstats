In 2008, Federer captured one Grand Slam, a singles title at the US Open over Andy Murray.[77] Federer was defeated by Nadal in two Grand Slam finals, the French Open and Wimbledon, which was regarded as the best match of tennis history by many, when he was going for six straight wins to break Bj√∂rn Borg's record. He came back from two sets down to force a fifth set, where he fell just two points from the title.[77] At the Australian Open, Federer lost in the semifinals to eventual winner Djokovic, which ended his record of 10 consecutive finals.[77] He lost twice in Masters Series 1000 finals on clay to Nadal, at Monte Carlo and Hamburg.[77] Federer captured three titles in 250-level events at Estoril, Halle, and Basel.[78][79][80]
