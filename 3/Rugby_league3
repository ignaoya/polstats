In rugby league, points are scored by carrying the ball and touching it to the ground beyond the opposing team's goal line; this is called a try, and is the primary method of scoring.[4] The opposing team attempts to stop the attacking side scoring points by tackling the player carrying the ball.[4] In addition to tries, points can be scored by kicking goals. Field goals can be attempted at any time, and following a successful try, the scoring team gains a free kick to try at goal with a conversion for further points.[4] Kicks at goal may also be awarded for penalties.
