In November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[555][556] In February 2021, Messi donated his Adidas shoes to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pel√©'s record for most goals scored for a single club, with the shoes being later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer.[557]
