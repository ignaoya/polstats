Just like professional golfer Bobby Jones, Joyce Wethered was considered to be a star in the 1920s.[63] Jones praised Wethered in 1930 after they had played an exhibition against each other. He doubted that there had ever been a better golfer, man or woman.[64] However, Bobby Jones' comment was not enough for others to change their views on women golfers.
