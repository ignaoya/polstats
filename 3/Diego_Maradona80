From the mid-1980s until 2004, Maradona was addicted to cocaine. He allegedly began using the drug in Barcelona in 1983.[256] By the time he was playing for Napoli, he had a full-blown addiction, which interfered with his ability to play football.[257] In the midst of his drug crisis in 1991, Maradona was asked by journalists if the hit song "Mi enfermedad" (lit. "My Disease") was dedicated to him.[258]
