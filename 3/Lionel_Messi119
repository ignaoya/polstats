Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Mat√≠as, manage his charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.[532]
