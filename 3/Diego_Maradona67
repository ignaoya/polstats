On 1 September 2014, Maradona, along with many current and former footballing stars, took part in the "Match for Peace", which was played at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, with the proceeds being donated entirely to charity.[216] Maradona set up a goal for Roberto Baggio during the first half of the match, with a chipped through-ball over the defence with the outside of his left foot.[217] Unusually, both Baggio and Maradona wore the number 10 shirt, despite playing on the same team.[217] On 17 August 2015, Maradona visited Ali Bin Nasser, the Tunisian referee of the Argentinaâ€“England quarter-final match at the 1986 World Cup where Maradona scored his Hand of God, and paid tribute to him by giving him a signed Argentine jersey.[218][219]
