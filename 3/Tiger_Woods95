Woods was raised as a Buddhist, and he actively practiced his faith from childhood until well into his adult, professional golf career.[232] In a 2000 article, Woods was quoted as saying that he "believes in Buddhism... not every aspect, but most of it."[233] He has attributed his deviations and infidelity to his losing track of Buddhism. He said, "Buddhism teaches me to stop following every impulse and to learn restraint. Obviously I lost track of what I was taught."[234]
