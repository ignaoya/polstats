After Portugal's unsuccessful performance in the European Championship, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United.[302] Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in July 2008.[303] Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup, as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina.[304] In the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches against Ivory Coast, North Korea, and Brazil.[305][306][307] His only goal of the tournament came in their 7–0 rout of North Korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months.[308] Portugal's World Cup ended with a 1–0 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16.[309]
