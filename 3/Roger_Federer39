The 2009 season was perhaps the most historically relevant of Federer's career as he completed a career Grand Slam by winning his first French Open title and won a men's record fifteenth Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon, surpassing Pete Sampras's mark of fourteen.[94] The Wimbledon final was also historic for being the longest Grand Slam final in terms of games played with Federer prevailing 16â€“14 in the fifth set.[93]
