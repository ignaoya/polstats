In the Aosta Valley, bread-thickened soups are customary as well as cheese fondue, chestnuts, potatoes, rice. Polenta is a staple along with rye bread, smoked bacon, motsetta  [ it] (cured chamois meat), and game from the mountains and forests. Butter and cream are important in stewed, roasted, and braised dishes.[85] Typical regional products include Fontina cheese, Vallée d'Aoste Lard d'Arnad, red wines and Génépi Artemisia-based liqueur.[86]
