Stout and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley, and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast. There are a number of variations including Baltic porter, dry stout, and Imperial stout. The name "porter" was first used in 1721 to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river porters of London.[104] This same beer later also became known as stout, though the word stout had been used as early as 1677.[105] The history and development of stout and porter are intertwined.[106]
