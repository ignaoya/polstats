The main active ingredient of wine is alcohol, and therefore, the health effects of alcohol apply to wine. A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found that moderate ethanol consumption brought no mortality benefit compared with lifetime abstention from ethanol consumption.[136] A systematic analysis of data from the Global Burden of Disease study found that consumption of ethanol increases the risk of cancer and increases the risk of all-cause mortality, and that the level of ethanol consumption that minimizes disease is zero consumption.[137] Some studies have concluded that drinking small quantities of alcohol (less than one drink in women and two in men)[how often?] is associated with a decreased risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and early death.[138]  Drinking more than this amount actually increases the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Some of these studies lumped former ethanol drinkers and life-long abstainers into a single group of nondrinkers, hiding the health benefits of life-long abstention from ethanol.[138] Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents.[138] About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year.[139]
