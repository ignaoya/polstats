Animals, specifically humans, have five different types of tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. As animals have evolved, the tastes that provide the most energy (sugar and fats) are the most pleasant to eat while others, such as bitter, are not enjoyable.[68] Water, while important for survival, has no taste.[69] Fats, on the other hand, especially saturated fats, are thicker and rich and are thus considered more enjoyable to eat.
