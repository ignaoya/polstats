France has various appellation systems based on the concept of terroir, with classifications ranging from Vin de Table ("table wine") at the bottom, through Vin de Pays and Appellation d'Origine Vin Délimité de Qualité Supérieure (AOVDQS), up to Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) or similar, depending on the region.[88][89] Portugal has developed a system resembling that of France and, in fact, pioneered this concept in 1756 with a royal charter creating the Demarcated Douro Region and regulating the production and trade of wine.[90] Germany created a similar scheme in 2002, although it has not yet achieved the authority of the other countries' classification systems.[91][92] Spain, Greece and Italy have classifications based on a dual system of region of origin and product quality.[93]
