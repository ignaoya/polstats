Yogurt (UK: /ˈjɒɡərt/; US: /ˈjoʊɡərt/,[1] from Turkish: yoğurt, Armenian: յոգուրտ)  also spelled yoghurt, yogourt or yoghourt, is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk.[2] The bacteria used to make yogurt are known as yogurt cultures. Fermentation of sugars in the milk by these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavor.[2] Cow's milk is commonly available worldwide and, as such, is the milk most commonly used to make yogurt. Milk from water buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels, yaks and plant milks are also used to produce yogurt. The milk used may be homogenized or not. It may be pasteurized or raw. Each type of milk produces substantially different results.
