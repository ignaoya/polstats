Long-term flooding of rice fields cuts the soil off from atmospheric oxygen and causes anaerobic fermentation of organic matter in the soil.[150] Methane production from rice cultivation contributes ~1.5% of anthropogenic greenhouse gases.[151] Methane is twenty times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.[152]
