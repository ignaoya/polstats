Most wines are sold in glass bottles and sealed with corks (50% of which come from Portugal).[154] An increasing number of wine producers have been using alternative closures such as screwcaps and synthetic plastic "corks". Although alternative closures are less expensive and prevent cork taint, they have been blamed for such problems as excessive reduction.[155]
