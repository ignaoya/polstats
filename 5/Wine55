Wine is important in cuisine not just for its value as a drink, but as a flavor agent, primarily in stocks and braising, since its acidity lends balance to rich savory or sweet dishes.[123] Wine sauce is an example of a culinary sauce that uses wine as a primary ingredient.[124] Natural wines may exhibit a broad range of alcohol content, from below 9% to above 16% ABV, with most wines being in the 12.5â€“14.5% range.[125] Fortified wines (usually with brandy) may contain 20% alcohol or more.
