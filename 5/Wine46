Wine grapes grow almost exclusively between 30 and 50 degrees latitude north and south of the equator. The world's southernmost vineyards are in the Central Otago region of New Zealand's South Island near the 45th parallel south,[114] and the northernmost are in Flen, Sweden, just north of the 59th parallel north.[115]
