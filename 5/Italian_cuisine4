Italian cuisine is generally characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only two to four main ingredients.[12] Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation.[13] Ingredients and dishes vary by region. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated with variations throughout the country.
