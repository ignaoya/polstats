Rice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe grisea,[166] is the most significant disease affecting rice cultivation. Other major rice diseases include: sheath blight (caused by Rhizoctonia solani), rice ragged stunt (vector: BPH), and tungro (vector: Nephotettix spp).[167] There is also an ascomycete fungus, Cochliobolus miyabeanus, that causes brown spot disease in rice.[168][169]
