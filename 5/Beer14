Beer was spread through Europe by Germanic and Celtic tribes as far back as 3000 BC,[39] and it was mainly brewed on a domestic scale.[40] The product that the early Europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today. Alongside the basic starch source, the early European beers may have contain fruits, honey, numerous types of plants, spices and other substances such as narcotic herbs.[41] What they did not contain was hops, as that was a later addition, first mentioned in Europe around 822 by a Carolingian Abbot[42] and again in 1067 by abbess Hildegard of Bingen.[43]
