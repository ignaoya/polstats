The origin of Oryza sativa rice domestication has been a subject of much debate among those who study crop history and anthropology - whether rice originated in India or China.[72][73] Asian rice, Oryza sativa, is one of oldest crop species. It has tens of thousands of varieties and two major subspecies, japonica and indica. Archeologists focusing on East and Southeast Asia argue that rice farming began in south-central China along the Yangtze River and spread to Korea and Japan from there south and northeast.[74][73] Archaeologists working in India argue that rice cultivation started in the valley of the Ganges River[75] and Indus valley,[76] by peoples unconnected to those of the Yangzte.[77][78][73]
