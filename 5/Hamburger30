Use of the term "steakburger" dates to the 1920s in the United States.[41] In the U.S. in 1934, A.H. "Gus" Belt, the founder of Steak 'n Shake, devised a higher-quality hamburger and offered it as a "steakburger" to customers at the company's first location in Normal, Illinois.[42] This burger used a combination of ground meat from the strip portion of T-bone steak and sirloin steak in its preparation.[42] Steak burgers are a primary menu item at Steak 'n Shake restaurants,[42] and the company's registered trademarks included "original steakburger" and "famous for steakburgers".[43] Steak 'n Shake's "Prime Steakburgers" are now made of choice grade brisket and chuck.[44]
