In China, due to the branding of their sandwiches by McDonald's and KFC restaurants in China, the word "burger" (汉堡) refers to all sandwiches that are consist of two pieces of bun and a meat patty in between. This has led to confusions when Chinese nationals try to order sandwiches with meat fillings other than beef in fast-food restaurants in North America.[82]
