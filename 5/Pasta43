Pasta exhibits a random molecular order rather than a crystalline structure.[50] The moisture content of dried pasta is typically around 12%,[51] indicating that dried pasta will remain a brittle solid until it is cooked and becomes malleable. The cooked product is, as a result, softer, more flexible, and chewy.[50]
