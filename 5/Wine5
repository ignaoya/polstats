The earliest archaeological and archaeobotanical evidence for grape wine and viniculture, dating to 6000â€“5800 BC was found on the territory of modern Georgia.[22][23] Both archaeological and genetic evidence suggest that the earliest production of wine elsewhere was relatively later, likely having taken place in the Southern Caucasus (which encompasses Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan), or the West Asian region between Eastern Turkey, and northern Iran.[24][25]
