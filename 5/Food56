Prison food is the term for meals served to prisoners while incarcerated in correctional institutions. While some prisons prepare their own food, many use staff from on-site catering companies. Many prisons today support the requirements of specific religions, as well as vegetarianism.[55] It is said that prison food of many developed countries is adequate to maintain health and dieting.[56][unreliable source?]
