Among rice cultivars, there are differences in the responses to, and recovery from, pest damage.[162][188][173] Many rice varieties have been selected for resistance to insect pests.[189][190][173] Therefore, particular cultivars are recommended for areas prone to certain pest problems.[173] The genetically based ability of a rice variety to withstand pest attacks is called resistance. Three main types of plant resistance to pests are recognized as nonpreference, antibiosis, and tolerance.[191] Nonpreference (or antixenosis) describes host plants which insects prefer to avoid; antibiosis is where insect survival is reduced after the ingestion of host tissue; and tolerance is the capacity of a plant to produce high yield or retain high quality despite insect infestation.[192]
