Food is traded and marketed on a global basis. The variety and availability of food is no longer restricted by the diversity of locally grown food or the limitations of the local growing season.[116] Between 1961 and 1999, there was a 400% increase in worldwide food exports.[117] Some countries are now economically dependent on food exports, which in some cases account for over 80% of all exports.[118]
