The cuisine of ancient Greece included a dairy product known as oxygala (οξύγαλα) which was similar to yogurt.[12][13][14][15] Galen (AD 129 – c. 200/c. 216) mentioned that oxygala was consumed with honey, similar to the way thickened Greek yogurt is eaten today.[15][14] The oldest writings mentioning yogurt are attributed to Pliny the Elder, who remarked that certain "barbarous nations" knew how "to thicken the milk into a substance with an agreeable acidity".[16] The use of yogurt by medieval Turks is recorded in the books Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk by Mahmud Kashgari and Kutadgu Bilig by Yusuf Has Hajib written in the 11th century.[17][18] Both texts mention the word "yogurt" in different sections and describe its use by nomadic Turks.[17][18] The earliest yogurts were probably spontaneously fermented by wild bacteria in goat skin bags.[19]
