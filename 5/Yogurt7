Analysis of the L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus genome indicates that the bacterium may have originated on the surface of a plant.[7] Milk may have become spontaneously and unintentionally exposed to it through contact with plants, or bacteria may have been transferred from the udder of domestic milk-producing animals.[8] The origins of yogurt are unknown, but it is thought to have been invented in Mesopotamia around 5000 BC.[9] In ancient Indian records, the combination of yogurt and honey is called "the food of the gods".[10] Persian traditions hold that "Abraham owed his fecundity and longevity to the regular ingestion of yogurt".[11]
