In October 2008, the Association of Lebanese Industrialists petitioned to the Lebanese Ministry of Economy and Trade to request protected status from the European Commission for hummus as a uniquely Lebanese food, similar to the Protected Geographical Status rights held over regional food items by various European Union countries.[45][46][47] As of late 2009, the Lebanese Industrialists Association was still "collecting documents and proof" to support its claim.[48]
