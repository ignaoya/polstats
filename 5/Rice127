Crop protection scientists are trying to develop rice pest management techniques which are sustainable. In other words, to manage crop pests in such a manner that future crop production is not threatened.[172] Sustainable pest management is based on four principles: biodiversity, host plant resistance (HPR),[173] landscape ecology, and hierarchies in a landscapeâ€”from biological to social.[174] At present, rice pest management includes cultural techniques, pest-resistant rice varieties,[173] and pesticides (which include insecticide). Increasingly, there is evidence that farmers' pesticide applications are often unnecessary, and even facilitate pest outbreaks.[175][176][177][178] By reducing the populations of natural enemies of rice pests,[179] misuse of insecticides can actually lead to pest outbreaks.[180] The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) demonstrated in 1993 that an 87.5% reduction in pesticide use can lead to an overall drop in pest numbers.[181] IRRI also conducted two campaigns in 1994 and 2003, respectively, which discouraged insecticide misuse and smarter pest management in Vietnam.[182][183]
