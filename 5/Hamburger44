In Mexico, burgers (called hamburguesas) are served with ham[74] and slices of American cheese fried on top of the meat patty. The toppings include avocado, jalape√±o slices, shredded lettuce, onion and tomato. The bun has mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard. In certain parts are served with bacon, which can be fried or grilled along with the meat patty. A slice of pineapple is also a usual option, and the variation is known as a "Hawaiian hamburger".
