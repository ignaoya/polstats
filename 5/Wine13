The ancient Romans planted vineyards near garrison towns so wine could be produced locally rather than shipped over long distances. Some of these areas are now world-renowned for wine production.[43] The Romans discovered that burning sulfur candles inside empty wine vessels kept them fresh and free from a vinegar smell.[44] In medieval Europe, the Roman Catholic Church supported wine because the clergy required it for the Mass. Monks in France made wine for years, aging it in caves.[45] An old English recipe that survived in various forms until the 19th century calls for refining white wine from bastardâ€”bad or tainted bastardo wine.[46]
