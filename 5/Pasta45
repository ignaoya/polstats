Another major component of durum wheat is protein which plays a large role in pasta dough rheology.[52] Gluten proteins, which include monomeric gliadins and polymeric glutenin, make up the major protein component of durum wheat (about 75â€“80%).[52] As more water is added and shear stress is applied, gluten proteins take on an elastic characteristic and begin to form strands and sheets.[52][53] The gluten matrix that results during forming of the dough becomes irreversibly associated during drying as the moisture content is lowered to form the dried pasta product.[54]
