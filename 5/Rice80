More than 100 varieties of rice are commercially produced primarily in six states (Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and California) in the U.S.[115] According to estimates for the 2006 crop year, rice production in the U.S. is valued at $1.88Â billion, approximately half of which is expected to be exported. The U.S. provides about 12% of world rice trade.[115] The majority of domestic utilization of U.S. rice is direct food use (58%), while 16% is used in each of processed foods and beer. 10% is found in pet food.[115]
