Barley, in the form of malt, brings the condensed tannins prodelphinidins B3, B9 and C2 into beer. Tryptophol, tyrosol, and phenylethanol are aromatic higher alcohols found in beer[206] as secondary products of alcoholic fermentation[207] (products also known as congeners) by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
