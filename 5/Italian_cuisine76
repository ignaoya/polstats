Castelmagno is a prized cheese of the region. Piedmont is also famous for the quality of its Carr√π beef (particularly bue grasso, "fat ox"), hence the tradition of eating raw meat seasoned with garlic oil, lemon, and salt; carpaccio; Brasato al vino, wine stew made from marinated beef; and boiled beef served with various sauces.[73]
