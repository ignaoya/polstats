Various sources credit different individuals with the invention of the hard-shell taco, but some form of the dish likely predates all of them.[16] Beginning from the early part of the twentieth century, various types of tacos became popular in the country, especially in Texas and California but also elsewhere.[17] By the late 1930s,  companies like Ashley Mexican Food and Absolute Mexican Foods were selling appliances and ingredients for cooking hard shell tacos, and the first patents for hard-shell taco cooking appliances were filed in the 1940s.[16]
