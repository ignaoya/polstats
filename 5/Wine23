Mead, also called honey wine, is created by fermenting honey with water, sometimes with various fruits, spices, grains, or hops. As long as the primary substance fermented is honey, the drink is considered mead.[76] Mead was produced in ancient history throughout Europe, Africa and Asia,[77] and was known in Europe before grape wine.[78]
