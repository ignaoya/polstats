There are also several other popular alcoholic drinks in Italy. Limoncello, a traditional lemon liqueur from Campania (Sorrento, Amalfi and the Gulf of Naples) is the second most popular liqueur in Italy after Campari.[105] Made from lemon, it is an extremely strong drink which is usually consumed in very small proportions, served chilled in small glasses or cups.[105]
