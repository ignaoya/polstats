Many cultures hold some food preferences and some food taboos. Dietary choices can also define cultures and play a role in religion. For example, only kosher foods are permitted by Judaism, halal foods by Islam, and in Hinduism beef is restricted.[200] In addition, the dietary choices of different countries or regions have different characteristics. This is highly related to a culture's cuisine.
