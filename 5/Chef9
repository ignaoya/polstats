A chef de partie, also known as a "station chef" or "line cook",[5] is in charge of a particular area of production. In large kitchens, each chef de partie might have several cooks or assistants. In most kitchens, however, the chef de partie is the only worker in that department.  Line cooks are often divided into a hierarchy of their own, starting with "first cook", then "second cook", and so on as needed.
