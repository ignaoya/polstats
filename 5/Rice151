Soil salinity poses a major threat to rice crop productivity, particularly along low-lying coastal areas during the dry season.[213] For example, roughly 1 million hectares of the coastal areas of Bangladesh are affected by saline soils.[217] These high concentrations of salt can severely affect rice plants' normal physiology, especially during early stages of growth, and as such farmers are often forced to abandon these otherwise potentially usable areas.[218][219]
