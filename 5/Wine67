Alcoholism is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in problems.[140] It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence.[141][142] In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use.[142] Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years[143] and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States.[138] No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine.[138][144]
