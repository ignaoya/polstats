There is a legend of Marco Polo importing pasta from China[17] which originated with the Macaroni Journal, published by an association of food industries with the goal of promoting pasta in the United States.[18] Rustichello da Pisa writes in his Travels that Marco Polo described a food similar to "lagana". Jeffrey Steingarten asserts that Arabs introduced pasta in the Emirate of Sicily in the ninth century, mentioning also that traces of pasta have been found in ancient Greece and that Jane Grigson believed the Marco Polo story to have originated in the 1920s or 30s in an advertisement for a Canadian spaghetti company.[19]
