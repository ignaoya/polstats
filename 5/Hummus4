The word hummus comes from Arabic: حُمُّص‎‎, romanized: ḥummuṣ 'chickpeas'.[6][2][7] The full name of the prepared spread in Arabic is ḥummuṣ bi ṭaḥīna 'chickpeas with tahini'.[8] The colloquial Arabic word ḥummuṣ is a variant of the Arabic ḥimmaṣ or ḥimmiṣ which may be derived from the Aramaic language (ḥemṣīn, ḥemṣāy[9]), corresponding to the Syriac word for chickpeas: ḥem(m)ṣē.[10] The word entered the English language around the mid-20th century from the Arabic ḥummuṣ or via its borrowing for the name of the dish in Turkish: humus.[11][12]
