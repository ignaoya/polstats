The origin of the Greek word is unclear. It is sometimes held to be from the Tamil word அரிசி (arisi), or rather Old Tamil 𑀅𑀭𑀺𑀘𑀺 (arici).[35][36] However, Krishnamurti[37] disagrees with the notion that Old Tamil arici is the source of the Greek term, and proposes that it was borrowed from descendants of Proto-Dravidian *wariñci instead. Mayrhofer[38] suggests that the immediate source of the Greek word is to be sought in Old Iranian words of the types *vrīz- or *vrinj-, source of the modern Persian word برنج (berenj), but these are ultimately traced back to Indo-Aryan (as in Sanskrit व्रीहि, vrīhí-).
