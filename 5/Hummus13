Although sometimes criticized as Jewish appropriation of Palestinian and Arab culture,[27] hummus has been adopted as an unofficial "national dish" of Israel, reflecting its huge popularity and significance among the entire Israeli population.[21] Many restaurants run by Mizrahi Jews and Arab citizens of Israel are dedicated to warm hummus,[21] which may be served as chick peas softened with baking soda along with garlic, olive oil, cumin and tahini. One of the hummus versions available is msabbaha, made with lemon-spiked tahini garnished with whole chick peas, a sprinkling of paprika and a drizzle of olive oil.[28]
