Rice cultivars also fall into groups according to environmental conditions, season of planting, and season of harvest, called ecotypes. Some major groups are the Japan-type (grown in Japan), "buly" and "tjereh" types (Indonesia); sali (or amanâ€”main winter crop), ahu (also aush or ghariya, summer), and boro (spring) (Bengal and Assam).[196][197] Cultivars exist that are adapted to deep flooding, and these are generally called "floating rice".[198]
