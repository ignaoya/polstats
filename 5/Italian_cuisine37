Each area has its own specialties, primarily at a regional level, but also at the provincial level. The differences can come from a bordering country (such as France or Austria), whether a region is close to the sea or the mountains, and economics.[42] Italian cuisine is also seasonal with priority placed on the use of fresh produce.[43][44]
