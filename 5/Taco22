The breakfast taco, found in Tex-Mex cuisine, is a soft corn or flour tortilla filled with meat, eggs, or cheese, and can also contain  other ingredients.[21] Some have claimed that Austin, Texas is the home of the breakfast taco.[22] However, food writer and OC Weekly editor Gustavo Arellano responded that such a statement reflects a common trend of "whitewashed" foodways reporting, noting that predominantly Hispanic San Antonio, Texas "never had to brag about its breakfast taco loveâ€”folks there just call it 'breakfast'".[23]
