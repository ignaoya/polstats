Other drinks called "wine", such as barley wine and rice wine (e.g. sake, huangjiu and cheongju), are made from starch-based materials and resemble beer  more than traditional  wine, while ginger wine is fortified with brandy. In these latter cases, the term "wine" refers to the similarity in alcohol content rather than to the production process.[79] The commercial use of the English word "wine" (and its equivalent in other languages) is protected by law in many jurisdictions.[80]
