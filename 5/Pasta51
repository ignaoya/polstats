When cooked, plain pasta is composed of 62% water, 31% carbohydrates (26% starch), 6% protein, and 1% fat. A 100-gram (3 1⁄2-ounce) portion of unenriched cooked pasta provides 670 kilojoules (160 kilocalories) of food energy and a moderate level of manganese (15% of the Daily Value), but few other micronutrients.
