First used in English in the middle of the 13th century, the word "rice" derives from the Old French ris, which comes from the Italian riso, in turn from the Latin orȳza, which derives from the Greek ὄρυζα (oruza). The Greek word is the source of all European words (compare Welsh reis, German Reis, Lithuanian ryžiai, Serbo-Croatian riža, Polish ryż, Dutch rijst, Hungarian rizs, Romanian orez, Spanish arroz).[32][33][34]
