Due to the varying levels that water can reach in regions of cultivation, flood tolerant varieties have long been developed and used. Flooding is an issue that many rice growers face, especially in South and South East Asia where flooding annually affects 20 million hectares.[210] Standard rice varieties cannot withstand stagnant flooding of more than about a week,[211] mainly as it disallows the plant access to necessary requirements such as sunlight and essential gas exchanges, inevitably leading to plants being unable to recover.[210]
In the past, this has led to massive losses in yields, such as in the Philippines, where in 2006, rice crops worth $65Â million were lost to flooding.[212] Recently developed cultivars seek to improve flood tolerance.
