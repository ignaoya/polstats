In Denmark, the hamburger was introduced in 1949, though it was called the bøfsandwich. There are many variations. While the original bøfsandwich was simply a generic meet patty containing a mix of beef and horse meat, though with slightly different garnish(sennep, ketchup and soft onions), it has continued to evolve. Today, a bøfsandwich usually contains a beef patty, pickled cucumber, raw, pickled, fried and/or soft onions, pickled red beets, mustard, ketchup, remoulade, and perhaps most strikingly, is often often overflowing with brown gravy, which is sometimes even poured on top of the assembled bøfsandwich. The original bøfsandwich is still on the menu at the same restaurant from which it originated in 1949, now run by the grandson of the original owner.[87]
