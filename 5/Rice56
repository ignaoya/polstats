In 2003, Korean archaeologists alleged they discovered burnt grains of domesticated rice in Soro-ri, Korea, which dated to 13,000 BC. These antedate the oldest grains in China, which were dated to 10,000 BC, and potentially challenge the mainstream explanation that domesticated rice originated in China.[81] The findings were received by academia with strong skepticism at first,[82][83] but later accepted in secondary sources such as the archaeology text book Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice.[84]
