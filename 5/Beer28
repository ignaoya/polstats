Water is the main ingredient of beer, accounting for 93% of its weight.[64] Though water itself is, ideally, flavorless, its level of dissolved minerals, specifically, bicarbonate ion, does influence beer's finished taste.[65] Due to the mineral properties of each region's water, specific areas were originally the sole producers of certain types of beer, each identifiable by regional characteristics.[66] Regional geology accords that Dublin's hard water is well-suited to making stout, such as Guinness, while the Plze≈à Region's soft water is ideal for brewing Pilsner (pale lager), such as Pilsner Urquell.[66] The waters of Burton in England contain gypsum, which benefits making pale ale to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as Burtonisation.[67]
