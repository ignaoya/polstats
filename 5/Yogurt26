Large amounts of sugar – or other sweeteners for low-energy yogurts – are often used in commercial yogurt.[40][42] Some yogurts contain added modified starch,[43] pectin (found naturally in fruit) or gelatin to create thickness and creaminess. This type of yogurt may be marketed under the name Swiss-style, although it is unrelated to conventional Swiss yogurt. Some yogurts, often called "cream line", are made with whole milk which has not been homogenized so the cream rises to the top. In many countries, sweetened, flavored yogurt is common, typically sold in single-serving plastic cups.[40] Common flavors may include vanilla, honey, and toffee, and various fruits.[40][42] In the early 21st century, yogurt flavors inspired by desserts, such as chocolate or cheesecake, became common.[42] There is concern about the health effects of sweetened yogurt due to its high sugar content,[40] although research indicates that use of sugar in yogurt manufacturing has decreased since 2016 in response to WHO and government initiatives to combat obesity.[40][44]
