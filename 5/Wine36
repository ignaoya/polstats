In the United States, for a wine to be vintage-dated and labeled with a country of origin or American Viticultural Area (AVA; e.g., Sonoma Valley), 95% of its volume must be from grapes harvested in that year.[97] If a wine is not labeled with a country of origin or AVA the percentage requirement is lowered to 85%.[97]
