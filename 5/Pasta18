At the beginning of the 17th century, Naples had rudimentary machines for producing pasta, later establishing the kneading machine and press, making pasta manufacturing cost-effective.[24] In 1740, a license for the first pasta factory was issued in Venice.[24] During the 1800s, water mills and stone grinders were used to separate semolina from the bran, initiating expansion of the pasta market.[24] In 1859, Joseph Topits (1824−1876) founded the first pasta factory of Hungary in the city of Pest, which worked with steam machines; it was one of the first pasta factories of Central Europe.[25] By 1867, Buitoni Company in Sansepolcro, Tuscany became an established pasta manufacturer.[26] During the early 1900s, artificial drying and extrusion processes enabled greater variety of pasta preparation and larger volumes for export, beginning a period called "The Industry of Pasta".[24][27] In 1884, the Zátka Brothers's plant in Boršov nad Vltavou was founded and this was the first pasta factory in Bohemia.[28]
