Drinking chilled beer began with the development of artificial refrigeration and by the 1870s, was spread in those countries that concentrated on brewing pale lager.[161] Chilling beer makes it more refreshing,[162] though below 15.5 °C (60 °F) the chilling starts to reduce taste awareness[163] and reduces it significantly below 10 °C (50 °F).[164] Beer served unchilled—either cool or at room temperature—reveal more of their flavours. Cask Marque, a non-profit UK beer organisation, has set a temperature standard range of 12°–14 °C (53°–57 °F) for cask ales to be served.[165]
