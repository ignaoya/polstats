Although the Adriatic coast is a major fishing area (well known for its eels and clams), the region is more famous for its meat products, especially pork-based, that include Parma's prosciutto, culatello, and Salame Felino  [ it]; Piacenza's pancetta, coppa, and salami; Bologna's mortadella and salame rosa; Zampone Modena  [ it], cotechino, and cappello del prete [ it]; and Ferrara's salama da sugo  [ it]. Piacenza is also known for some dishes prepared with horse and donkey meat. Regional desserts include zuppa inglese (custard-based dessert made with sponge cake and Alchermes liqueur) and panpepato (Christmas cake made with pepper, chocolate, spices, and almonds).
