Italy's legacy from the days when Libya was invaded by Italy can be seen in the popularity of pasta on its menus, particularly sharba, a highly spiced Libyan soup. Bazin, a local specialty, is a hard paste made from barley, salt and water, and one of the most popular meals in the Libyan cuisine is batata mubatana (filled potato),  consisting of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs.
