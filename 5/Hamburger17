Various non-specific claims of invention relate to the term "hamburger steak" without mention of its being a sandwich. The first printed American menu which listed hamburger is said to be an 1834 menu from Delmonico's in New York.[25] However, the printer of the original menu was not in business in 1834.[22] In 1889, a menu from Walla Walla Union in Washington offered hamburger steak as a menu item.[9]
