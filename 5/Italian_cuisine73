Ascoli, Marche's southernmost province, is well known for olive ascolane  [ it], (stoned olives stuffed with several minced meats, egg, and Parmesan, then fried).[72] Another well-known Marche product are the Maccheroncini di Campofilone [ it], from little town of Campofilone, a kind of hand-made pasta made only of hard grain flour and eggs, cut so thin that melts in one's mouth.
