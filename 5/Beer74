In many societies, beer is the most popular alcoholic drink. Various social traditions and activities are associated with beer drinking, such as playing cards, darts, or other pub games; attending beer festivals; engaging in zythology (the study of beer);[182][183] visiting a series of pubs in one evening; visiting breweries; beer-oriented tourism; or rating beer.[184] Drinking games, such as beer pong, are also popular.[185] A relatively new profession is that of the beer sommelier, who informs restaurant patrons about beers and food pairings.
