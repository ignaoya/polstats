The country was then split for a long time and influenced by surrounding countries such as Spain, France and Central Europe. This and the trade or the location on the Silk Road with its routes to Asia influenced the local development of special dishes. Due to the climatic conditions and the different proximity to the sea, different basic foods and spices were available from region to region. Regional cuisine is represented by some of the major cities in Italy. For example, Milan (north of Italy) is known for risottos, Trieste (northeast of Italy) is known for multicultural food, Bologna (the central/middle of the country) is known for its tortellini, and Naples (the south) is famous for its pizzas.[15] A good example is the well-known spaghetti where it is believed that they spread across Africa to Sicily and then on to Naples.[16][17]
