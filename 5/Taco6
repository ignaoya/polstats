Indigenous origins for the culinary word "taco" are also proposed. One possibility is that the word derives from the Nahuatl word "tlahco", meaning "half" or "in the middle,"[3] in the sense that food would be placed in the middle of a tortilla.[4] Furthermore, dishes analogous to the taco were known to have existed in Pre-Columbian societyâ€”for example, the Nahuatl word "tlaxcalli" (a type of corn tortilla).[3]
