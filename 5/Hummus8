As an appetizer and dip, diners scoop hummus with flatbread, such as pita.[21] It is also served as part of a meze or as an accompaniment to falafel, grilled chicken, fish, or eggplant.[21] Garnishes include chopped tomato, cucumber, coriander, parsley, caramelized onions, saut√©ed mushrooms, whole chickpeas, olive oil, hard-boiled eggs, paprika, sumac, ful, olives, pickles, and pine nuts. Outside the Middle East, it is sometimes served with tortilla chips or crackers.
