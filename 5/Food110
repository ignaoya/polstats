Price levels depend on the food production process, including food marketing and food distribution. Fluctuation in food prices is determined by a number of compounding factors.[126] Geopolitical events, global demand, exchange rates,[127] government policy, diseases and crop yield, energy costs, availability of natural resources for agriculture,[128] food speculation,[129][130][131] changes in the use of soil and weather events have a direct impact on the increase or decrease of food prices.[132]
