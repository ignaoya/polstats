Most beers are cleared of yeast by filtering when packaged in bottles and cans.[153] However, bottle conditioned beers retain some yeastâ€”either by being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast.[154] It is usually recommended that the beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with wheat beers. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.
