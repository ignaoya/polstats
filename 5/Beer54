Beer ranges from less than 3% alcohol by volume (abv) to around 14% abv, though this strength can be increased to around 20% by re-pitching with champagne yeast,[120] and to 55% abv by the freeze-distilling process.[121] The alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style.[122] The pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of 4–6%, with a typical abv of 5%.[123] The customary strength of British ales is quite low, with many session beers being around 4% abv.[124] In Belgium, some beers, such as table beer are of such low alcohol content (1%–4%) that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools.[125]
