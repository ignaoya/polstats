Household food security exists when all members, at all times, have access to enough food for an active, healthy life.[175] Individuals who are food secure do not live in hunger or fear of starvation.[176] Food insecurity, on the other hand, is defined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a situation of "limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways".[177] Food security incorporates a measure of resilience to future disruption or unavailability of critical food supply due to various risk factors including droughts, shipping disruptions, fuel shortages, economic instability, and wars. In the years 2011â€“2013, an estimated 842 million people were suffering from chronic hunger.[178] The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, or FAO, identified the four pillars of food security as availability, access, utilization, and stability.[179] The United Nations (UN) recognized the Right to Food in the Declaration of Human Rights in 1948,[176] and has since said that it is vital for the enjoyment of all other rights.[180]
