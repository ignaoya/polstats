Restaurants employ chefs to prepare the food, and waiters to serve customers at the table.[102] The term restaurant comes from an old term for a restorative meat broth; this broth (or bouillon) was served in elegant outlets in Paris from the mid 18th century.[103][104] These refined "restaurants" were a marked change from the usual basic eateries such as inns and taverns,[104] and some had developed from early Parisian cafés, such as Café Procope, by first serving bouillon, then adding other cooked food to their menus.[105]
