Lebanon and Israel have been engaged in a competition over the largest dish of hummus, as validated by the Guinness World Record, as a form of contestation of "ownership".[44] The "title" has gone back and forth between Israel (2008), Lebanon (2009), Israel (January 2010),[51] and, as of 2021[update], Lebanon (May 2010).[44][52][53] The winning dish, cooked by 300 cooks in the village of al-Fanar, near Beirut, weighed approximately 10,450 kilograms (23,040 lb), more than double the weight of the previous record.[54][55][56] According to local media, the recipe included eight tons of boiled chick peas, two tonnes of tahini, two tonnes of lemon juice, and 70 kilograms (150 lb) of olive oil.[52]
