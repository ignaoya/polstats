Following the popularity of the bøfsandwich, many variations sprung up, using different types of meat instead of the beef patty. One variation, the flæskestegssandwich, grew especially popular. This variation replaces the minced beef patty with slices of pork loin or belly, and typically uses sweet-and-sour pickled red cabbage, mayonnaise, mustard, and pork rinds as garnish.[88]
