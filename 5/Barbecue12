According to estimates, prior to the American Civil War, Southerners ate around five pounds of pork for every pound of beef they consumed.[18] Because of the effort to capture and cook these wild hogs, pig slaughtering became a time for celebration and the neighborhood would be invited to share in the largesse. In Louisiana Creole and Cajun culture, these feasts are called boucheries or "pig pickin's". The traditional Southern barbecue grew out of these gatherings.[19]
