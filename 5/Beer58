The product claimed to be the strongest beer made is Schorschbräu's 2011 Schorschbock 57 with 57,5%.[134][135] It was preceded by The End of History, a 55% Belgian ale,[121] made by BrewDog in 2010. The same company had previously made Sink The Bismarck!, a 41% abv IPA,[136] and Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a 32% abv Imperial stout. Each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing, in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed, until the desired strength is reached,[137][138] a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer.[139] The German brewery Schorschbräu's Schorschbock, a 31% abv eisbock,[140][141][142] and Hair of the Dog's Dave, a 29% abv barley wine made in 1994, used the same fractional freezing method.[143] A 60% abv blend of beer with whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a Dutch brewery in July 2010.[144][145]
