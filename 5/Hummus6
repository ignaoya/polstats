Although multiple different theories and claims of origins exist in various parts of the Middle East, evidence is insufficient to determine the precise location or time of the invention of hummus.[14] Its basic ingredients—chickpeas, sesame, lemon, and garlic—have been combined and eaten in Egypt and the Levant over centuries.[15][16] Though regional populations widely ate chickpeas, and often cooked them in stews and other hot dishes,[17] puréed chickpeas eaten cold with tahini do not appear before the Abbasid period in Egypt and the Levant.[18]
